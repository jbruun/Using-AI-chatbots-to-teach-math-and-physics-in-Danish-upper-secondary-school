We used the cognitive linguistic framework of experientialism to shed new light on this valuable pool of studies to identify the conceptual resources of understanding climate change. In our study, we interviewed 35 secondary school students on their understanding of the greenhouse effect and analysed the conceptions of climate scientists as drawn from textbooks and research reports. We analysed all data by metaphor analysis and qualitative content analysis to gain insight into students' and scientists' resources for understanding. In our analysis, we found that students and scientists refer to the same schemata to understand the greenhouse effect. We categorised their conceptions into three different principles the conceptions are based on: warming by more input, warming by less output, and warming by a new equilibrium. By interrelating students' and scientists' conceptions, we identified the students' learning demand: First, our students were afforded with experiences regarding the interactions of electromagnetic radiation and CO2. Second, our students reflected about the experience-based schemata they use as source domains for metaphorical understanding of the greenhouse effect. By uncovering the-mostly unconscious-deployed schemata, we gave students access to their source domains. We implemented these teaching guidelines in interventions and evaluated them in teaching experiments to develop evidence-based and theory-guided learning activities on the greenhouse effect. © 2013 Taylor \& Francis.},

Using a co-design method, researchers worked with a high school biology teacher to create a rainforest simulation, distributed across several large displays in the room to immerse students in the environment. The authors created and evaluated two iterations of a design where students gathered evidence of evolution using networked tablet computers that scaffolded their interactions with peers and with the room itself. Outcomes suggest that the immersive simulation engaged students, helped them to establish and build upon ideas about evolution and promoted learning of challenging biological concepts. Student explanations from the second implementation demonstrated increased variation in ideas about evolutionary topics compared to those in the first iteration. Relevant design features from the two iterations are discussed. © 2013 © 2013 Association for Information Technology in Teacher Education.},

In particular, I argue that the teacher's bodily performance in the classroom setting communicates the Platonic position of abstract-realism-that mathematical entities are ontologically real abstractions-which is associated with the high epistemological authority and social efficacy of mathematics. Thus, in addition to the teacher's use of language to reference mathematical knowledge, I document her patterns of embodied social action, which communicate an additional and ideologically specific theory about the ontological status of the items thus referenced. I propose the concept of a metaphor of participation-an iconic projection based on the pattern of bodily participation in the speech event-as a tool to theorize the bodily communication of ideologies. © 2014 by the American Anthropological Association.},

	abstract = {These 2 studies investigate the extent to which an Embodied Mixed Reality Learning Environment (EMRELE) can enhance science learning compared to regular classroom instruction. Mixed reality means that physical tangible and digital components were present. The content for the EMRELE required that students map abstract concepts and relations onto their gestures and movements so that the concepts would become grounded in embodied action. The studies compare an immersive, highly interactive learning platform that uses a motion-capture system to track students' gestures and locomotion as they kinesthetically learn with a quality classroom experience (teacher and content were held constant). Two science studies are presented: chemistry titration and disease transmission. In the counterbalanced design 1 group received the EMRELE intervention, while the other group received regular instruction; after 3 days and a midtest, the interventions switched. Each study lasted for 6 days total, with 3 test points: pretest, midtest, and posttest. Analyses revealed that placement in the embodied EMRELE condition consistently led to greater learning gains (effect sizes ranged from 0.53 to 1.93), compared to regular instruction (effect sizes ranged from 0.09 to 0.37). Order of intervention did not affect the final outcomes at posttest. These results are discussed in relation to a new taxonomy of embodiment in educational settings. We hypothesize that the positive results are due to the embodiment designed into the lessons and the high degree of collaboration engendered by the co-located EMRELE. © 2013 American Psychological Association.},

	abstract = {Objective: A feasibility study was run on an embodied exergame designed to teach 4th-12th grade students about nutrition and several U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) MyPlate guidelines. The study assessed efficacy on a new version of a game that was first implemented on an immersive platform and published in this journal in 2013. The earlier "Alien Health" game was redesigned for use with the Microsoft® (Redmond, WA) Kinect® sensor. Players learned about the amount of nutrients and optimizers in common food items and practiced making food choices while engaging in short cardio exercises. Subjects and Methods: Twenty 6th and 7th graders were randomly assigned to either the "Alien Health" game or a treated control condition. All engaged in "front of the classroom" performative activities. The "Alien Health" experimental group experienced the full game narrative of feeding the Alien and automated feedback on the quality of performed exercises. The control group experienced the same performative food choices at the interactive whiteboard but did no exercises. Two-week follow-up data were collected. Results: Both groups displayed statistically significant learning gains on the immediate nutrition knowledge posttest. The effect sizes from pretest to 2-week follow-up were 0.83 for the control group and 1.14 for the experimental group. Of interest is the crossover interaction from posttest to follow-up that approached significance (F19=3.96, P{\textless}0.058). Here, the experimental group outperformed the control group for knowledge retention. Conclusions: Results suggest acceptability, feasibility, and limited efficacy in a Kinect-based game to instruct in nutrition and the USDA MyPlate icon. The follow-up test revealed that nutrition knowledge continued to increase for the experimental group that performed short cardio exercises, suggesting that short exercises and perhaps a game narrative may have helped to consolidate content memory. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.},

	abstract = {Learning astronomy involves significant spatial reasoning, such as learning to describe Earth-based phenomena and understanding space-based explanations for those phenomena as well as using the relevant size and scale information to interpret these frames of reference. This study examines daily celestial motion (DCM) as one case of how children learn to move between frames of reference in astronomy wherein one explains Earth-based descriptions of the Sun's, Moon's, and stars' apparent motion using the Earth's daily rotation. We analysed interviews with 8-9-year-old students (N = 99) who participated in one of four instructional conditions emphasizing: the space-based perspective; the Earth-based perspective in the planetarium; constructing explanations for the Earth-based observations; and a combination of the planetarium plus constructing explanations in the classroom. We used an embodied cognition framework to analyse outcomes while also considering challenges learners face due to the high cognitive demands of spatial reasoning. Results support the hypothesis that instruction should engage students in learning both the Earth-based observations and space-based explanations, as focusing on a single frame of reference resulted in less sophisticated explanations; however, few students were able to construct a fully scientific explanation after instruction. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor \& Francis.},

We videotaped 18 lessons (3 from each of 6 teachers), and within each, we identified linking episodes-segments of discourse in which the teacher connected mathematical ideas. For each link, we identified the modalities teachers used to express linked ideas and coded whether the content was new or review. Teachers communicated most links multimodally, typically using speech and gestures. Teachers' gestures included depictive gestures that simulated actions and perceptual states, and pointing gestures that grounded utterances in the physical environment. Compared to links about new material, teachers were less likely to express links about review material multimodally, especially when that material had been mentioned previously. Moreover, teachers gestured at a higher rate in links about new material. Gestures are an integral part of teachers' communication during mathematics instruction. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Twenty-three 7th graders, playing as dyads, used gestures to manipulate virtual gears. The Kinect sensor tracked arm-spinning movements and switched gear diameters. Knowledge tests were administered. Statistically significant knowledge gains were seen. For Game 1 (gear spun one direction), switching significantly predicted only pretest knowledge. For Game 2 (gear spun two directions) switching was also negatively correlated with both tests. For game 2, those who used fewer switches during gameplay understood the construct better scoring higher on both tests. Dyadic analyses revealed the winner used significantly fewer switches. In-process data can provide a window onto knowledge as it is being encoded. However, games should stay within the learner's ZPD, because if the game is too easy (Game 1), meaningful data may be difficult to gather.

However, teachers often struggle to integrate emergent multimodal models into a technology-rich informal learning environment. Our design-based research co-designs and develops engaging, immersive, and interactive informal learning activities called “Embodied Modeling-Mediated Activities” (EMMA) to support not only Singaporean learners’ deep learning of astronomy but also the capacity of teachers. As part of the research on EMMA, this case study describes two prospective teachers’ co-design processes involving multimodal models for teaching and learning the concept of the seasons in a technology-rich informal learning setting. Our study uncovers four prominent themes emerging from our data concerning the contextualized nature of learning and teaching involving multimodal models in informal learning contexts: (1) promoting communication and emerging questions, (2) offering affordances through limitations, (3) explaining one concept involving multiple concepts, and (4) integrating teaching and learning experiences. This study has an implication for the development of a pedagogical framework for teaching and learning in technology-enhanced learning environments—that is empowering teachers to become active sense-makers using multimodal models. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) emphasize authentic scientific practices such as developing models and constructing explanations of phenomena. However, research documents how students struggle to explain observable phenomena with molecular-level behaviors with current classroom experiences. For example, physical laboratory experiences in science enable students to interact with observable scientific phenomena, but students often fail to make connections to underlying molecular-level behaviors. Virtual laboratory experiences and computer-based visualizations enable students to interact with unobservable scientific concepts, but students can have difficulties connecting to actual instantiations of the observed phenomenon. This paper investigates how combining physical and virtual experiences into augmented virtual science laboratories can help students build upon intuitive ideas and develop molecular-level explanations of macroscopic phenomena. Specifically, this study uses the Frame, a sensor-augmented virtual lab that uses sensors as physical inputs to control scientific simulations. Eighth-grade students (N = 45) engaged in a Frame lab focused on the properties of gas. Results demonstrate that students using the Frame lab made progress developing molecular-level explanations of gas behavior and refining alternative and partial ideas into normative ideas about gases. This study offers insights for how augmented virtual labs can be designed to enhance science learning and encourage scientific practices as called for in the NGSS. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this blended space, naturally occurring learner interactions like body movement, gesture, and metaphorical speech are blended with a conceptual metaphor of energy as a substance in a class of activities called Energy Theater. We illustrate several mechanisms by which the blended aspect of the learning environment promotes productive intellectual engagement with key conceptual issues in the learning of energy, including distinguishing among energy processes, disambiguating matter and energy, identifying energy transfer, and representing energy as a conserved quantity. Conceptual advancement appears to be promoted especially by the symbolic material and social structure of the Energy Theater environment, in which energy is represented by participants and objects are represented by areas demarcated by loops of rope, and by Energy Theater's embodied action, including body locomotion, gesture, and coordination of speech with symbolic spaces in the Energy Theater arena. Our conclusions are (1) that specific conceptual metaphors can be leveraged to benefit science instruction via the blending of an abstract space of ideas with multiple modes of concrete human action, and (2) that participants’ structured improvisation plays an important role in leveraging the blend for their intellectual development. © 2015 Texas State University.},

For younger students, motion interfaces can stimulate development of motor skills and let students be physically active during the school day. In this article, an evaluation is presented of a Kinect educational game where students learn to recycle using body gestures. The focus of the evaluation was to investigate potential advantages using gesture-interfaces in educational games, how the game affected the students' engagement, motivation and learning, and if there were any social preferences for playing the game. The results show that elementary school students get highly motivated and engaged playing a Kinect recycling game. The students also report that they learn from playing this game and prefer such game-based learning to traditional lectures. Finally, the students preferred playing this game as a multi-player game, where the boys preferred to play competitive while the girls preferred playing collaboratively.

The term “agent” in the context of ABMs indicates individual computational objects or actors that obey simple rules assigned or controlled by the user. It is the interactions between these agents that give rise to emergent, aggregate-level behaviors in complex systems. While several researchers have argued for the effectiveness of ABMs for learning about complex systems, the design of classroom activity systems using ABMs, especially for elementary students, has received relatively less attention. In this paper, we report on a 2-week long proof-of-concept study conducted in a third-grade classroom of 15 students in which students began with an embodied modeling activity of foraging behavior, followed with the generation of mathematical inscriptions based on their embodied actions, and finally, conducted further inquiry of interdependence in an ecosystem using two separate ABMs. Furthermore, we show that the lens of mechanistic reasoning can be productively used to identify the process of students’ conceptual development of interdependence in an ecosystem as they engage in the modeling activities. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Explaining many astronomical phenomena, especially those studied in elementary and middle school, requires shifting between an Earth-based description of the phenomena and a space-based reference frame. We studied 7- to 9-year-old children (N = 15) to (a) develop a method for capturing how children make connections between reference frames and to (b) explore connections between perspective-taking skill and the nature of children's explanations. Children's explanations for the apparent motion of the Sun and stars and for seasonal changes in constellations were coded for accuracy of explanation, connection between frames of reference, and use of gesture. Children with higher spatial perspective-taking skills made more explicit connections between reference frames and used certain gesture-types more frequently, although this pattern was evident for only some phenomena. Findings suggest that children – particularly those with lower perspective-taking skills – may need additional support in learning to explicitly connect reference frames in astronomy. Understanding spatial thinking among children who successfully made explicit connections between reference frames in their explanations could be a starting point for future instruction in this domain. © 2016 Taylor \& Francis.},

	abstract = {This study examined the non-verbal patterns of interaction within an intensive mathematics intervention context. Specifically, the authors draw on social constructivist worldview to examine a teacher’s use of gesture in this setting. The teacher conducted a series of longitudinal teaching experiments with a small number of young, school-age children in the context of early arithmetic development. From these experiments, the authors gathered extensive video records of teaching practice and, from an inductive analysis of these records, identified three distinct patterns of teacher gesture: behavior eliciting, behavior suggesting, and behavior replicating. Awareness of their potential to influence students via gesture may prompt teachers to more closely attend to their own interactions with mathematical tools and take these teacher interactions into consideration when forming interpretations of students’ cognition. © 2015, Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc.},

GaNA is an ecological game-based learning framework that was conceptualized for facilitating teachers in selecting and using games. Projective reflection is an identity change process catalyzed by digital game play and facilitated by reflection and discussion activities focused within a domain. From September-December 2010, a game, Dimension M was used to facilitate students' in gameplay to construct mathematics knowledge, motivation to learn, and identity change. Data sources included interviews, in-class participant and video observations, and pre-post assessments. Students had statistically significant gains in mathematics. Students engaged in identity exploration activities that allowed them to value mathematics. The implications of projective reflection and GaNA are discussed. Further studies are needed for scaling and replicating the use of projective reflection. © Copyright 2016 IGI Global.},

This paper describes the research design and methodology of an intervention study examining the effect of classroom-based PA on mathematical achievement, creativity, executive function, body mass index and aerobic fitness. Methods: The study was designed as a school-based cluster-randomized controlled trial targeting schoolchildren in 1st grade, and was carried out between August 2012 and June 2013. Eligible schools in two municipalities in the Region of Southern Denmark were invited to participate in the study. After stratification by municipality, twelve schools were randomized to either an intervention group or a control group, comprising a total of 505 children with mean age 7.2 ± 0.3 years. The intervention was a 9-month classroom-based PA program that involved integration of PA into the math lessons delivered by the schools' math teachers. The primary study outcome was change in math achievement, measured by a 45-minute standardized math test. Secondary outcomes were change in executive function (using a modified Eriksen flanker task and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) questionnaire filled out by the parents), creativity (using the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, TTCT), aerobic fitness (by the Andersen intermittent shuttle-run test) and body mass index. PA during math lessons and total PA (including time spent outside school) were assessed using accelerometry. Math teachers used Short Message Service (SMS)-tracking to report on compliance with the PA intervention and on their motivation for implementing PA in math lessons. Parents used SMS-tracking to register their children's PA behavior in leisure time. Discussion: The results of this randomized controlled trial are expected to provide schools and policy-makers with significant new insights into the potential of classroom-based PA to improve cognition and academic achievement in children.

	abstract = {Spatial thinking skills positively relate to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) outcomes, but spatial training is largely absent in elementary school. Elementary school is a time when children develop foundational cognitive skills that will support STEM learning throughout their education. Spatial thinking should be considered a foundational cognitive skill. The present research examined the impact of an embodied spatial training program on elementary students’ spatial and mathematical thinking. Students in rural elementary schools completed spatial and math assessments prior to and after participating in an origami and pop-up paper engineering-based program, called Think3d!. Think3d! uses embodied tasks, such as folding and cutting paper, to train two-dimensional to three-dimensional spatial thinking. Analyses explored spatial thinking gains, mathematics gains – specifically for problem types expected to show gains from spatial training – and factors predicting mathematics gains. Results showed spatial thinking gains in two assessments. Using a math categorization to target problems more and less likely to be impacted by spatial training, we found that all students improved on real-world math problems and older students improved on visual and spatial math problems. Further, the results are suggestive of developmental time points for implementing embodied spatial training related to applying spatial thinking to math. Finally, the spatial thinking assessment that was most highly related to training activities also predicted math performance gains. Future research should explore developmental issues related to how embodied spatial training might support STEM learning and outcomes. © 2017, The Author(s).},

Research investigating the use of physical and virtual experiments to support students’ learning has identified a variety of, sometimes conflicting, outcomes. Unanswered questions remain about how physical and virtual experiments may impact students’ learning and for which contexts and content areas they may be most effective. Using a quasi-experimental design, we examined eighth grade students’ (N = 100) learning of physics concepts related to pulleys depending on the sequence of physical and virtual labs they engaged in. Five classes of students were assigned to either the: physical first condition (PF) (n = 55), where students performed a physical pulley experiment and then performed the same experiment virtually, or virtual first condition (VF) (n = 45), with the opposite sequence. Repeated measures ANOVA’s were conducted to examine how physical and virtual labs impacted students’ learning of specific physics concepts. While we did not find clear-cut support that one sequence was better, we did find evidence that participating in virtual experiments may be more beneficial for learning certain physics concepts, such as work and mechanical advantage. Our findings support the idea that if time or physical materials are limited, using virtual experiments may help students understand work and mechanical advantage. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

The qualitative analysis focuses on one group of students (n = 9) based on audio recordings and field notes that were taken by the teacher during one lesson as well as during a follow-up group interview. Findings include that students manage to conceptualize heat as a process, and using the IR camera serves as a shared point of attention in visual and verbal communication.

This study examined the effects of using Dynamic Geometry Software (DGS) CABRI to manipulate geometric properties of triangles or observing those manipulations made by an instructor on learning geometric properties with DGS-CABRI. Participants were 60 year 5 students, who received instructions on geometric problems and were randomly assigned to three conditions: A condition in which they performed mouse movements to manipulate geometric properties of triangles, a condition in which they observed the teacher performing those manipulations, and a conventional condition in which they studied a static format of the learning materials without any manipulations. We hypothesized that learning conditions involving manipulations of geometric properties of triangles would result in lower cognitive load and higher performance on a retention and transfer test than the conventional condition. Moreover, we hypothesized that making manipulations of the geometric properties of triangles through mouse movements would be superior to observing those manipulations being made by an instructor in terms of cognitive load, retention- and transfer test performance. Whereas the first hypothesis was confirmed, the latter hypothesis was only confirmed for retention test performance. Possible implications for educational practice are discussed. © 2017},

The study aimed to bring computational thinking, an applicable skill set in computer science, into existing mathematics and programming education in elementary classrooms. An essential component of computational thinking is the ability to think like a computer scientist when confronted with a problem (Grover and Pea in Educ Res 42(1):38–43. doi:10.3102/0013189X12463051, 2013). Computational perspectives (Berland and Wilensky in J Sci Educ Technol 24(5):628–647. doi:10.1007/s10956-015-9552-x, 2015) refer to the frame of reference programmers or computer scientists adopt when approaching a problem. The study examined the effects of taking computational perspectives through various degrees of embodied activities (i.e., full vs. low) on students’ achievement in mathematics and programming. The study employed a 2 (full vs. low embodiment) × 2 (with vs. without computational perspective taking) factorial condition to evaluate four learning conditions from a combination of embodiment and computational perspective-taking practice. The results from this experimental study (N = 66 kindergarten and first graders) suggest that full-embody activities combined with the practice of computational perspective-taking in solving mathematics problem improved mathematics understanding and programming skills as demonstrated in Scrath Jr. among novice young learners. Moreover, the practice of using a computational perspective significantly improved students’ understanding of core programming concepts regardless of the level of embodiment.

	abstract = {We develop a theory of grounded and embodied mathematical cognition (GEMC) that draws on action-cognition transduction for advancing understanding of how the body can support mathematical reasoning. GEMC proposes that participants’ actions serve as inputs capable of driving the cognition-action system toward associated cognitive states. This occurs through a process of transduction that promotes valuable mathematical insights by eliciting dynamic depictive gestures that enact spatio-temporal properties of mathematical entities. Our focus here is on pre-college geometry proof production. GEMC suggests that action alone can foster insight but is insufficient for valid proof production if action is not coordinated with language systems for propositionalizing general properties of objects and space. GEMC guides the design of a video game-based learning environment intended to promote students’ mathematical insights and informal proofs by eliciting dynamic gestures through in-game directed actions. GEMC generates several hypotheses that contribute to theories of embodied cognition and to the design of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education interventions. Pilot study results with a prototype video game tentatively support theory-based predictions regarding the role of dynamic gestures for fostering insight and proof-with-insight, and for the role of action coupled with language to promote proof-with-insight. But the pilot yields mixed results for deriving in-game interventions intended to elicit dynamic gesture production. Although our central purpose is an explication of GEMC theory and the role of action-cognition transduction, the theory-based video game design reveals the potential of GEMC to improve STEM education, and highlights the complex challenges of connecting embodiment research to education practices and learning environment design. © 2017, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Plant nutrition and photosynthesis is one of the most difficult issues teachers are confronted with in science classes. This can be due to alternative conceptions students’ hold, which are often profoundly contrary to their scientific counterparts. Consequently, fruitful learning environments should build on learners’ alternative conceptions to initiate conceptual change towards a more scientific understanding. In this qualitative case study, high-school students’ pre-instructional conceptions about plant nutrition were identified empirically. Afterwards these students were exposed to the van-Helmont experiment in order to create a cognitive conflict. The learning processes and signs of conceptual change were identified using Qualitative Content Analysis. The results show that the van-Helmont experiment does not trigger conceptual change but reinforces students’ pre-instructional conceptions. Ultimately, a cognitive-linguistic analysis using Conceptual Metaphor Theory was conducted. Interestingly, underlying embodied conceptions and image schemas about human nutrition became evident. These thinking patterns were used metaphorically and, therefore, can be seen as the basis to understand plant nutrition. As a result, we propose a reverse approach of teaching photosynthesis and nutrition. Our Dissimilation-Before-Assimilation approach takes learners’ alternative conceptions and underlying image schemas into account in order to promote a fruitful learning of the concepts of plant nutrition. © 2018 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: Students' knowledge of scientific principles of evolution is often inadequate, despite its recognized importance for understanding biology. Moreover, difficulties associated with underlying abstract concepts such as randomness and probability can hinder successful learning of evolutionary concepts. Studies show that visualizations, particularly simulations together with appropriate instructional support, facilitate the learning of abstract concepts. Therefore, we have developed interactive, web-based simulation software called EvoSketch in efforts to help learners grasp the nature and importance of random and probabilistic processes in evolutionary contexts. We applied EvoSketch in an intervention study comparing four self-directed study conditions: learning with EvoSketch (1) alone, (2) combined with interpretative support, (3) combined with reflective support, and (4) using texts about randomness and probability instead of EvoSketch. All conditions received no support from any instructors. Knowledge about evolution as well as randomness and probability in the context of evolution, time-on-task, and perceived cognitive load were measured. A sample of 269 German secondary school students (M                              age                              = 15.6 years, SD = 0.6 years) participated in the study. Results: Learners using EvoSketch without additional support obtained higher follow-up test scores regarding their knowledge of randomness and probability than those using the text-based approach. However, use of the simulations together with given instructional support (interpretative or reflective) did not increase students' performance, relative to the text-based approach. In addition, no significant between-intervention differences were found concerning the knowledge of evolution, while significant differences between the groups were detected concerning students' perceived cognitive load and time-on-task. Conclusions: From our findings, we conclude that EvoSketch seems to have a very small positive effect on students' understanding of randomness and probability. Contrary to our expectations, additional self-directed instructional support did not improve students' understanding, probably because it was not necessary to understand EvoSketch simulations. When using EvoSketch in the classroom, we recommend increasing the intervention timeframe to several sessions and a variety of evolutionary examples for which EvoSketch serves as an underlying framework.                          © 2018 The Author(s).},

Pre-and post-assessment results showed that students in both settings learned at similar rates. Additionally, we analyzed the language used during the activity and found that students in the individual setting used more spatial language early in the activity, while students in the whole-class setting used more metaphors. This finding was likely due to differences in the perspectives students have when physically engaging with the angle compared to the perspective when observing someone else engage with the embodied-interaction. © 2018, International Journal of Research in Education and Science.

	abstract = {According to general relativity (GR), we live in a four-dimensional curved universe. Since the human mind cannot visualize those four dimensions, a popular analogy compares the universe to a two-dimensional rubber sheet distorted by massive objects. This analogy is often used when teaching GR to upper secondary and undergraduate physics students. However, physicists and physics educators criticize the analogy for being inaccurate and for introducing conceptual conflicts. Addressing these criticisms, we analyze the rubber sheet analogy through systematic metaphor analysis of textbooks and research literature, and present an empirical analysis of upper secondary school students’ use and understanding of the analogy. Taking a theoretical perspective of embodied cognition allows us to account for the relationship between the experiential and sensory aspects of the metaphor in relation to the abstract nature of spacetime. We employ methods of metaphor and thematic analysis to study written accounts of small groups of 97 students (18–19 years old) who worked with a collaborative online learning environment as part of their regular physics lessons in five classes in Norway. Students generated conceptual metaphors found in the literature as well as novel ones that led to different conceptions of gravity than those held by experts in the field. Even though most students showed awareness of some limitations of the analogy, we observed a conflict between students’ embodied understanding of gravity and the abstract description of GR. This conflict might add to the common perception of GR being counterintuitive. In making explicit strengths and weaknesses of the rubber sheet analogy and learners’ conceptual difficulties, our results offer guidance for teaching GR. More generally, these findings contribute to the epistemological implications of employing specific scientific metaphors in classrooms. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

The purpose of this work is to evaluate an interactive augmented three-dimensional (3D) tangible map on which students interact and travel with their fingers. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 58 fourth-grade students from eight elementary schools participated in the study. The participants played with the FingerTrips environment in 24 sessions and in groups of two or three. Each session lasted for about 20-25 min. After completing the interactive game, the students answered a questionnaire concerning their attitudes toward the tangible environment and participated in a short interview. Findings: Students’ responses revealed that FingerTrips managed to transform the experience of meeting new places, understanding spatial relations and learning geography. Students supported that such an approach is closer to their interactive experiences and expectations, and exploits embodied learning affordances to achieve enjoyable learning. Students identified their finger-based trips as an effective and intriguing static haptic guidance that helped them learn more effectively. Originality/value: The specific approach has two distinctive characteristics. First, a new interaction style on the map is suggested, the use of trips with fingers. Students have to follow predefined engraved paths on the 3D terrain to sense distances and changes in altitude and “touch” the topology asked to understand and explore. Second, it is examined whether a low fidelity interactive 3D terrain, which can be easily reconstructed and reprogrammed by primary school students, can become a useful canvas for learning geography. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We compared the learning of two eight-grade classrooms that used the embodied modelling simulation during a weeklong learning module on phase change, with a comparison group that used an ordinary simulation with no embodied modelling. In the pre-test, neither group mentioned inter-molecular forces in their explanations. In the post-test, significantly more students from the embodied modelling group mentioned inter-molecular bonds in their explanations than their counterparts who used the regular simulation, and realised that inter-molecular forces influence the motion of particles. However, we found little difference between the groups in students’ ability to relate the magnitude of the inter-molecular forces to the magnitude of the boiling point of the material, showing not only the potential but also the limits in developing complex conceptualisations through this approach. Building on these findings, we discuss the affordances of embodied modelling for learning complex models, and suggest future directions for research into embodied modelling. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Using sound and music as a metaphor to approach curricular mathematical contents in Primary Education seems an interesting field that deserves some research. Both music and sound can synergically act as scaffolding for learning, intervening as part of situated knowledge, and they could offer a new perspective for learning mathematics at schools, giving pupils opportunities to develop their own mental representations. Also, the incorporation of an affective/emotional analysis, as criteria for evaluation, seems pertinent and complementary to other criteria in the production of multimedia material with educational purposes both in formal and non-formal domains of education. These are the intentions of the present work, which shows the design, implementation and assessment of AudioFractions, as part of an educational software package called Sound Interactive Music- Mathematics, which was conceived to aid mathematical learning through sound and music in Chilean Primary Education. The investigation was carried out in a three-stage design: 1) generate significant metaphors; 2) implement and test functional software prototypes and didactic guidelines; and 3) assess the software. Pupils in risk of social exclusion at three priority public schools in Santiago de Chile (N=137; 9-11 years old) were subjected to AudioFractions in one 60-minute session. Then, students filled a questionnaire validated by experts with their perceptions about the software and their emotions. Results of the four assessment variables (global, technical, mathematical, musical) plus an affective-emotional assessment, show an excellent reception of AudioFractions. © 2019 Institute for Innovation in Science and Mathematics Education.},

We used the Kinect sensor from Microsoft in our studies to identify the movements and gestures of the user. This interface was used by us in teaching Chemistry in a Middle School and High School by developing a virtual chemical laboratory, which is based on a system of hand movements. We have analyzed the gestures and movements of the virtual chemical laboratory user to determine how they raise the effectiveness in chemical education. The results show how much better students work with a virtual laboratory, when studied by us in chemical areas, that concerned remembering information, understanding information, applying their experience in situations familiar to them from school and in solving chemical problems. © 2017 British Educational Research Association},

	abstract = {This study contributes to our understanding of meaning making in CSCL environments by examining a specific aspect of collaborative problem solving in which students improvise, introduce, and make meaning with representations in disciplinary domains. These situations include the embodied and imaginative processes of discovering new representational possibilities and artifact meanings. Much of the research on student-generated representations examines situations in which students are asked by a teacher or researcher explicitly to produce representations. However, we need more knowledge about how students within CSCL settings introduce representations from outside of the designed environment or intended task in order to solve a problem. To unpack the processes of collaborative improvisation and meaning making, we take a sociocultural stance towards imagining. This stance involves considering the socially and materially situated ways that participants express new possibilities and alternative situations that extend beyond the present reality. Focusing on a specific task based on maps as disciplinary representations, we analyze video data of upper secondary physics students working in small groups in a co-located CSCL environment. To characterize shifts across boundaries of several modalities including the verbal and gestural, digital and physical, and 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional, we identify emergent representations as imaginative productions. The findings extend current research on collaborative meaning making by bringing attention to the processes through which improvised representations emerge. This knowledge is key to facilitating the discovery of representational possibilities in CSCL environments. © 2019, International Society of the Learning Sciences, Inc.},

	abstract = {In this study, we investigated the development of algebraic reasoning in 65 fifth-grade students who never had algebra instruction before. In the six-lesson teaching sequence on solving linear equations, a hanging mobile, a physical balance model, played the central role. We expected students’ perceptual-motor experiences with this hanging mobile to be beneficial for the development of their reasoning related to linear equation solving. To investigate how students’ reasoning developed, we analysed videos of classroom interactions, students’ written work during the lessons and students’ responses to lesson-specific assessment tasks. Our results reveal that students showed progress in their level of algebraic reasoning and in their writing down of strategies. While working with the hanging mobile, students applied algebraic strategies such as restructuring, isolation and substitution. They later used these algebraic strategies for solving linear equations in new contexts. This suggests that the experiences students gained in the embodied learning environment provided a basis for algebraic reasoning, which appeared to support them when solving systems of symbolically presented linear equations. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The purpose of this study was to examine how design features in 12 digital math games influenced children's learning. The participants in this study were 193 children in Grades 2 through 6 (ages 8–12). During clinical interviews, children in the study completed pre-tests, interacted with digital math games, responded to questions about the digital math games, and completed post-tests. We recorded the interactions using two video perspectives that recorded children's gameplay and responses to interviewers. We employed mixed methods to analyze the data and identify salient patterns in children's experiences with the digital math games. The analysis revealed significant gains for 9 of the 12 digital games and most children were aware of the design features in the games. There were eight prominent categories of design features in the video data that supported learning and mathematics connections. Six categories focused on how the design features supported learning in the digital games. These categories included: accuracy feedback, unlimited/multiple attempts, information tutorials and hints, focused constraint, progressive levels, and game efficiency. Two categories were more specific to embodied cognition and action with the mathematics, and focused on how design features promoted mathematics connections. These categories included: linked representations and linked physical actions. The digital games in this study that did not include linked representations and opportunities for linked physical actions as design features did not produce significant gains. These results suggest the key role of mathematics-specific design features in the design of digital math games. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The results showed that the tracing group outperformed the non-tracing group on a subsequent test and reported lower levels of test difficulty.

	abstract = {The Human Orrery is a representation of the Solar System at a human scale, on which positions of planets over time are symbolized by different discs. Learners can then walk along the orbits of the planets with the right pace. This pedagogical tool uses the principles of enacted cognition to promote a better understanding of the scientific laws of dynamics. Enaction assumes that cognition is based on action. Applied to pedagogy, it implies that learning of concepts must be based on gestures and perceptions first. I applied during 2 years an enacted pedagogical sequence using our Human Orrery to different populations of learners. The main purpose was the understanding of velocity and inertia by KS4 classes (14–16 years old). Interviews and closed questions reveal a qualitative enhancement of the motivation and well-being of the learners during the enacted sequence. To evaluate further the impact of the enacted sequence, I formulated 2 open questions. The first one concerns the relation between distance, duration, and velocity through the period of planets. The second one focuses on inertia and gravity through the comparison of the free fall of an apple on Earth and the orbit of the Moon around Earth. The questions were asked to KS4 pupils after the enacted sequence (experimental classes) and to KS4, undergraduate and pre-teachers after a classical lecture on dynamics (demonstration classes). Quantitative analysis of the answers reveals specific cognitive insight, especially for students reasoning about velocity and trajectories. The general purpose of this paper is thus to illustrate the use of the Human Orrery in the context of science education in the classroom and to make a first, preliminary demonstration of its efficiency. © 2017, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.},

	abstract = {The metaphor of the mental number line accounts for numerous empirical effects of spatial-numerical associations. In the present study, we aimed at investigating directional spatial-numerical associations reflected by SNARC-like digit-direction and sign-direction congruency effects as well as the sign-digit compatibility effect when 6th graders performed magnitude comparisons of multi-symbol numbers (i.e., positive and negative numbers). As spatial-numerical associations were associated with sensorimotor experiences, we used whole-body and finger tapping responses to manipulate the extent of motor responses. We only observed a SNARC-like digit-direction congruency effect, but neither a sign-direction congruency nor a sign-digit compatibility effect. This indicates that 6th graders may already have developed spatial-numerical associations for absolute number magnitude, but not yet for polarity signs. Furthermore, not observing a sign-digit compatibility effect seemed to suggest that 6th graders may not yet process multi-symbol numbers in the same parallel componential way as adults do. We argue that while 6th graders are able to process negative numbers, they are not yet automatically associated with space or integrated in the place-value structure of the Arabic number system like multi-digit numbers are at this age. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor \& Francis.},

We asked quartets to view the recordings, explain what performers were doing by reenacting what they noticed in the video, and create their own performances using props akin to those in the recording. In response, participants explored symmetries and transformations of quadrilaterals and triangles. We contribute to research on distributed, embodied mathematical learning at four levels. First, we argue for design research that engages in creative re-use by foraging in public media for performances with mathematical potential, then designing activities that invite learners to dissect and reenact these performances to explore that potential. Second, we analyze quartets’ work as a form of ensemble learning that hybridizes dance and mathematics. Third, we describe interactions that produced intercorporeality in the material work of quartets. Finally, we argue for reenactment as a supplement to methods of Interaction Analysis, using our own analysis as an illustration of this novel approach. © 2019, FIZ Karlsruhe.},

Then, they dissected the resulting swept space into discrete units of measure by coordinating measures of the lengths of the sides, including side lengths measured in different units, such as “squeegee” and inch. Analysis of classroom discourse, formative assessments, and flexible interviews conducted 2 months after instruction illustrated that students developed dynamic images and meanings of area and its measure. These expanded their understanding of multiplicative product to include referent-transforming quantity and provided means for re-envisioning the meaning of the commutative and distributive properties of multiplication. Students employed these properties to relate fractional and whole number area products. Dynamic generation and dissection in tandem helped students bridge discrete and continuous conceptions of area and its measure. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor \& Francis.},

	abstract = {Contemporary research has explored educational robotics, but it has not examined the development of computational thinking in the context of programming embodied interactions. Apart from the goal of the robot and how the robot will interact with its environment, another important aspect that should be taken into consideration is whether and how the user will physically interact with the robot. We recruited 36 middle school students to participate in a six-session robotics curriculum in an attempt to expand their learning in computational thinking. Participants were asked to develop interfaces for the remote control of a robot using diverse interaction styles from low-level to high-level embodiment, such as touch, speech, and hand and full-body gestures.We measured students' perception of computing, examined their computational practices, and assessed the development of their computational thinking skills by analyzing the sophistication of the projects they created during a problem-solving task.We found that students who programmed combinations of low embodiment interfaces or interfaces with no embodiment produced more sophisticated projects and adopted more sophisticated computational practices compared to those who programmed full-body interfaces. These findings suggest that there might be a tradeoff between the appeal and the cognitive benefit of rich embodied interaction with a remotely controlled robot. In further work, educational robotics research and competitions might be complemented with a hybrid approach that blends the traditional autonomous robot movement with student enactment. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine the effect of motor skills training on arithmetical abilities among 80 first graders. One of the results showed that the intervention group, which received training in fine motor skills for 10 min, showed greater improvements in performance on an arithmetic task and a pegboard than did the active control group, which read their favourite book for 10 min. These findings have suggested that training in this study is an appropriate program for improving fine motor skills and further fine motor skills had a significant influence on arithmetical abilities in children, with a medium effect size. The present study has, for the first time, provided evidence that there will be a causal relationship between these factors. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

However, these compensatory materials are frequently found to offer students inferior opportunities for engaging in mathematical practice and do not allow sensorily heterogenous students to collaborate. Such prevailing problems of access and interaction are central concerns of Universal Design for Learning (UDL), an engineering paradigm for inclusive participation in cultural praxis like mathematics. Rather than directly adapt existing artifacts for broader usage, UDL process begins by interrogating the praxis these artifacts serve and then radically re-imagining tools and ecologies to optimize usability for all learners. We argue for the utility of two additional frameworks to enhance UDL efforts: (a) enactivism, a cognitive-sciences view of learning, knowing, and reasoning as modal activity; and (b) ethnomethodological conversation analysis (EMCA), which investigates participants’ multimodal methods for coordinating action and meaning. Combined, these approaches help frame the design and evaluation of opportunities for heterogeneous students to learn mathematics collaboratively in inclusive classrooms by coordinating perceptuo-motor solutions to joint manipulation problems. We contextualize the thesis with a proposal for a pluralist design for proportions, in which a pair of students jointly operate an interactive technological device. © 2018, FIZ Karlsruhe.},

We first discuss the theoretical basis of our engine design, drawing on Systemic Functional Grammar, embodied cognition and perceived animacy. This design aims to help children draw on the appearances of characters, props and scenery to evoke linguistic constructs leading to the emergence of stories. The second part of this paper reports on an empirical study where we aim to answer two research questions. First can compositions so produced be seen as valid compositions? To answer this question we conducted a linguistic analysis of coded stories and those written in an English classroom, and also using teacher ratings of these stories. Results indicate that while there are no significant linguistic differences between coded and English stories, coded stories are impoverished and should be seen as a first-draft to be revised in the English classroom. The second question was to probe our observation that while coding, children spontaneously told stories. Here we draw upon theories of embodied cognition and of perceived animacy. Our analysis suggests that these theories, taken together, help to explain the spontaneous emergence of stories. © University of Antwerp.},

Scientists make meaning through processes such as perspective taking, finding patterns, and following intuitions. In this paper, we focus on how a group of fourth grade learners and their teacher engaged in interpretation in ways that align with core ideas and practices in kinematics and computing. Cycles of measuring and modeling––including computer programming––helped to support classroom interactions that highlighted the interpretive nature of modeling and participation in model construction as a knowledge-building process. We draw on literature from the history and philosophy of science in order to analyze the students’ interpretive actions as forms of epistemic and representational agency, constituting a construct we term disciplined interpretation. We demonstrate how students’ disciplined interpretative moves help to position them as owners of their own design decisions and their rights to interpret the phenomena they were modeling, data collected from those phenomena, and the scientific and computational models themselves. We present four extended episodes that characterize the nature of activity in the classroom and the development of students’ disciplined interpretations in terms of learning to recognize scientific patterns amid complex perceptual fields, and to represent them in ways that support sensemaking. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Constructing explanatory models, in which students learn to visualize the mechanisms of unobservable entities (e.g., molecules) to explain the working of observable phenomena (e.g., air pressure), is a key practice of science. Yet, students struggle to develop and utilize such models to articulate causal-mechanistic explanations. In this paper, we argue that representational gesturing with the hands (i.e., gesturing that models semantic content) can support the development of explanatory models. Through case studies examining middle school students gesturing during sensemaking, we show that representational gestures can support students in at least four ways: (a) they make underlying mechanisms visible, (b) they facilitate translation of a spatial model to a verbal explanation, (c) they enable model articulation while relying less on scientific terminology, and (d) they present opportunities for students to embody causal agents. In these ways, representational gesturing can be considered an epistemic tool supporting students during sensemaking and communication. We argue that instruction should attend to students’ gestures and, as appropriate, encourage students to gesture as a means of aiding the construction and articulation of causal-mechanistic explanations. While our study explores one form of embodied representation, we encourage the field to explore embodied expressions as epistemic tools for learning. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Using DOWM, we found that strategy use was ordered as expected, from unskilled sensorimotor strategies to abstract strategies, and from less to more efficient in terms of speed and accuracy. This order aligns with the idea that perceptual learning is central to the emergence of abstract conceptual knowledge. Moreover, the current study shows that the DOWM does not preclude forward and backward transitions and even occasional transitions that skip certain strategies in the ordering. The DOWM seems a promising tool to developmentally capture the breadth of behavioral repertoire children display when they adopt new strategies for various problem-solving tasks.                          © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

This study contributes to our understanding of collaboration with abstract concepts by examining particular activities where bodily and experiential understandings may conflict with the conceptual domain. Specifically, upper secondary physics classrooms studying Einstein’s general theory of relativity are taken as a setting to identify the representational practices and conceptual challenges that arise when learners attempt to make meaning with, and express conflicting notions of, space and time. To unpack these challenges, we draw on the concept of imagination and on theoretical perspectives that treat imagining as a social activity. We also present the concept of metaimagining to characterize layered processes in which learners attend to and manage shifts between their own imaginative activities. This concept is illustrated through a detailed analysis of an extended conversation between 2 upper secondary physics students working with general relativity and spacetime. The students perform a diverse set of imaginative activities that are strongly tied to communicative, cognitive, and bodily action. We also show how the unique domain of general relativity presents particular challenges to student meaning making of abstract concepts which in turn prompt metaimagining. Based on our analysis, we offer recommendations to improve instructional practices in general relativity and argue for the consideration of imagining as a transdisciplinary competency in math and science education. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

Structural equation modeling techniques were used to uncover the unique predictive value and mediation of 4 predictors. The results indicated that each of these factors made a unique contribution to the prediction of later mathematics achievement; when estimated simultaneously, basic numerical skills were the strongest predictor, which suggests that domain-specific factors have a greater impact on mathematics achievement than domain-general factors. A strong direct and indirect predictor was updating. Nevertheless, indirect effects of fine motor skills and an inhibition/switching factor indicated that domain-general skills have a direct impact on early domain-specific precursors and through them an indirect effect on mathematics achievement.

This paper addresses the issue of how these 21st century skills of interpreting and creating graphs can be supported in a six-lesson teaching sequence about graphing motion. In this teaching sequence, we focused on the potential of an embodied learning environment to facilitate the development of primary school students’ reasoning about motion graphs by having primary school students (9–11 years) ‘walk’ graphs in front of a motion sensor to generate distance-time graphs. We asked: How does students’ reasoning about graphing motion develop over a six-lesson teaching sequence within an embodied learning environment? Based on the collected data, we examined changes in students’ level of reasoning on graph interpretation and graph construction tasks using a repeated measurement design. Additionally, we present two teaching episodes showing instances of how perceptual-motor experiences during the lessons aided students’ reasoning about graphical representations of motion. Results show that students went from iconic understanding towards understanding in which they reasoned based on one or two variables when interpreting and constructing graphical representations of motion events. At these higher levels of reasoning these students showed understanding of modelling motion in line with the intended 21st century skills of generating, refining, and evaluating graphs. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Embodied interaction with tangible interactive objects can be beneficial for introducing abstract scientific concepts, especially for young learners. Nevertheless, there is limited comparative evaluation of alternative interaction modalities with contemporary educational technology, such as tablets and robots. In this study, we explore the effects of touch and gestural interaction with a tablet and a robot, in the context of a primary education physics course about the notion of friction. For this purpose, 56 students participated in a between-groups study that involved four computationally enhanced interventions which correspond to different input and output modalities, respectively: (1) touch-virtual, (2) touch-physical, (3) hand gesture-virtual, and (4) hand gesture-physical. We measured students’ friction knowledge and examined their views. We found that the physical conditions had greater learning impact concerning friction knowledge compared to the virtual way. Additionally, physical manipulation benefited those learners who had misconceptions or limited initial knowledge about friction. We also found that students who used the more familiar touchscreen interface demonstrated similar learning gains and reported higher usability compared to those using the hand-tilt interface. These findings suggest that user interface familiarity should be carefully balanced with user interface congruency, in order to establish accessibility to a scientific concept in a primary education context. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Cells are central to the study of biology, yet many learners have difficulties understanding the abstract yet fundamental foundation of life. Research suggests that students' conceptions of cells are reinforced by current biology learning materials, which represent cells as two dimensional, highly ordered, and mostly empty. These models also inaccurately represent the number, location, and size of organelles. We examine the effect of an inquiry-based three-dimensional virtual reality (VR) game on high school students' mental models of cells. Students reported that the game was more interactive and engaging than traditional ways of learning about cells and attributed an improved understanding of cells to their game experience. Students' post drawings of cells depicted more types of organelles, increased density of organelles, and additional complexity than their pretest drawings, indicating a movement towards more accurate mental models of cells. However, students' scores did not improve on their factual knowledge about cells between the pretest and the post-game biology assessments. We discuss the implications of incorporating game-based approaches and new technologies such as VR into biology education. © 2020, IICM. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper gives a grounded cognition account of model-based learning of complex scientific knowledge related to socio-scientific issues, such as climate change. It draws on the results from a study of high school students learning about the carbon cycle through computational agent-based models and investigates two questions: First, how do students ground their understanding about the phenomenon when they learn and solve problems with computer models? Second, what are common sources of mistakes in students’ reasoning with computer models? Results show that students ground their understanding in computer models in five ways: direct observation, straight abstraction, generalisation, conceptualisation, and extension. Students also incorporate into their reasoning their knowledge and experiences that extend beyond phenomena represented in the models, such as attitudes about unsustainable carbon emission rates, human agency, external events, and the nature of computational models. The most common difficulties of the students relate to seeing the modelled scientific phenomenon and connecting results from the observations with other experiences and understandings about the phenomenon in the outside world. An important contribution of this study is the constructed coding scheme for establishing different ways of grounding, which helps to understand some challenges that students encounter when they learn about complex phenomena with agent-based computer models. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

The reported studies involved two courses from an upper secondary school and two courses from a lower secondary school. Upper secondary school classes studied topics of motion physics, and lower secondary school classes explored issues related to geography. In each grade, there was an “experimental group” that carried out their study using robotics and cooperative learning and a “control group” that studied the same concepts without robots. Students in both classes were subjected to tests before and after the robotics laboratory, to check their knowledge in the topics covered. Our initial hypothesis was that classes involving educational robotics and cooperative learning are more effective in improving learning and stimulating the interest and motivation of students. As expected, the results showed that students in the experimental groups had a far better understanding of concepts and higher participation to the activities than students in the control groups. © Copyright © 2020 D'Amico, Guastella and Chella.},

In two experiments, 11- to 13-year-old students were asked to study the worked examples on angles relationships involving parallel lines (experiment 1) and laws of exponents (experiment 2) either without tracing instruction, with textual attention cueing instruction, or tracing instruction. The tracing group outperformed the other two groups on a subsequent test and reported lower levels of test difficulty in experiment 1 but not in experiment 2, suggesting that the cognitive effect of tracing gesture was beyond guiding attention in the learning from highly visuospatial-based worked examples but not in the materials that are less obviously visuospatial in nature. The present findings suggested that tracing gesture offers a simple yet effective embodied technique that may further enhance the worked example-based learning through its cognitive effect specifically on the task involved with spatial information. © 2019, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.},

One case involves discussing and enacting projectile motion. The other case involves discussing and trying different configurations of bicycle gearing. The cases illustrate a short-term conceptual change in response to the discrepant experiences in which the same explanatory elements remained in their explanations over time, but how various ideas and perceived attributes of the situation were organized changed. Together, these cases illustrate an additional trigger for conceptual dynamics that have been as yet undocumented in literature about interviews. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Researchers have supported that movement-based interaction afforded by emerging embodied digital educational games may heighten even more immersion and learning. However, there is lack of empirical research warranting these claims. This case study has investigated the impact of high-embodied digital educational game, integrated in a primary school classroom, on children’s immersion and content knowledge about nutrition (condition1 = 24 children), in comparison to the impact of a low-embodied version of the game (condition2 = 20 children). Post-interventional surveys investigating immersion indicated that there was difference only on the level of engagement, in terms of perceived usability, while children’s learning gains in terms of content knowledge did not differ among the two conditions. Interviews with a subset of the children (n = 8 per condition) resulted in the identification of (a) media form, (b) media content and (c) context-related factors, which provided plausible explanations about children’s experienced immersion. Implications are discussed for supporting immersion in high-embodied educational digital games. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

To demonstrate the uses and limits of LEAF, we apply it to data from several iterations of the Science through Technology Enhanced Play (STEP) project. This project involved first and second-grade students using an embodied, mixed-reality simulation to learn about the particulate nature of matter. We use data from this project to demonstrate the ways in which students’ embodied actions serve as a resource in understanding their embodied activity both individually and collectively. We demonstrate how both dimensions provide insight into student cognition and learning.

	abstract = {Science and mathematics teacher professional development in South Africa does not adequately address teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge or ability to integrate indigenous knowledge into the curriculum. This situation is partly due to traditional teacher professional development programmes that utilise top-down and expert-driven approaches without consulting teachers. This “one-size-fits-all” model is rarely relevant to teachers’ classroom realities, especially in rural areas. The research question that guided this research was: How could the professional development intervention be contextualised to better meet the educational needs of a rural environment? In this paper, we explore the design principles for teacher professional development interventions that could address the needs of teachers and the context, acknowledging that teachers in rural areas face different challenges compared to teachers in urban areas. We use the Hantam region of the Northern Cape Province as a case study to explore the affordances of partnerships with local indigenous knowledge holders and cultural institutions (museums) in the professional development of teachers. Data were generated from semi-structured interviews with Hantam school and community participants using a qualitative approach. Two major themes that emerged from this qualitative research was that (a) the involvement of indigenous knowledge holders and museums as “third partners” in the value chain between universities and schools, could greatly assist to better contextualise the “western” science curriculum, and (b) the incorporation of indigenous knowledge in the STEM curriculum could assist in building the self-esteem of learners. We argue that contextualising science and mathematics teacher professional development for the rural environment has affordances for improving not only teacher competencies, but also learners’ views on the relevance of science and mathematics in everyday life. © Creative Commons With Attribution (CC-BY)},

Central to this unit was an innovative device designed to create a productive pedagogical space between student intuition for steepness and formal definition of slope. Nine students from a US middle school engaged with the design in one-on-one video-recorded interviews. Analysis of the data indicates that a majority of students appropriated the mathematics of slope to support their intuitive judgments regarding steepness. Comparing the cases of three students suggests conceptual learning milestones. Overall, the findings show that students' successful coordination of steepness and slope demand that their analytical and intuitive constructions be surfaced and integrated multiple times throughout the learning experience. To support students in connecting the mathematics of slope to their perceptions of steepness, educators can plan for students' multiple ways of viewing situations involving slope. © 2019 British Society for Research into Learning Mathematics.},

Therefore, the aim of the study was to introduce specific astronomical content to in-service primary school teachers through two didactic games, to evaluate the didactic games and the teachers’ knowledge and understanding before and after the implementation of the didactic games. The research included 24 in-service primary school teachers. The data were collected through the knowledge test (pre-post design) and questionnaires for each didactic game. The results showed that the teachers evaluated the didactic games as suitable for use in the classroom as they emphasized that they are educational, explicit and interesting. The implementation was identified as effective because the median for fractional gains was 0.54 and showed the medium gain in teachers’ knowledge and understanding of selected astronomy contents. It was recognized that in-service primary school teachers do not feel competent for introducing complex astronomical contents to their students. However, the presented approach could encourage in-service primary school teachers to deepen their knowledge and to teach astronomy contents with a method that is closer to their students. University teachers could point out the advantages and disadvantages of didactic games in astronomy content and discuss them with pre-service primary school teachers. © 2020, Scientia Socialis Ltd.

	abstract = {This study examined what factors might have a positive impact on students’ learning outcomes in mathematical understanding and computational thinking skills. Specifically, whether the proposed instructional design combining computational perspectives and an embodied approach in mathematics learning improves (a) mathematics learning, (b) problem-solving skills in programing, and (c) computational thinking. The study used a quantitative quasi-experimental design with 115 second- to fourth-grade students. Findings suggested that embodied activities combined with the practice of taking computational perspectives in solving mathematics problems led to improved knowledge in mathematics, programing concepts, and computational thinking among young learners. This paper also discusses how to make the computational thinking process more concrete and relevant within the context of mathematics to promote computational thinking skills. © 2020 ISTE.},

	abstract = {Environmental crises require collective and sustained action. However, pro-environmental action (PEA) has been mostly approached as an individual process. Further, conventional approaches to promote PEA assume an information-processing model of actions based on knowledge acquisition, which has been critiqued. Recent environmental education approaches emphasize more complex, non-linear models of action and focus on the acquisition of action-competence, which allows students to feel empowered to act in their local communities. Extending this approach, the potential of using the school as a base to involve other members of a community to engage in collective pro-environmental practices is a promising, but under-researched, direction to address sustainability issues. In this school-based case-study, we explored the development of action-competence, particularly the processes that lead up to such competence, by facilitating an urban farming project (40 students, 12-13 years old, tracked for 10 months). We studied students' interaction with farming structures and entities closely, taking an analysis approach inspired by: (1) recent work highlighting the affective-aesthetic appeal of environmental entities and (2) embodied cognition models. Based on these data and analysis, we show how meaningful and embodied encounters with nature contribute to the enhancement of students' environmental “action-space”. More interestingly, sharing of these “action-spaces” with adults, through various social experiences, motivated adults to participate in PEAs. This case-study is relevant to environmental educators and researchers seeking to design proactive interventions and explore general principles underlying collective environment-oriented actions. © 2019 by the Regents of the University of California.},

	abstract = {This article investigates the perception of students in the first year of high school in relation to their own body language, while mathematically they conjecture a way to improve their performance in an electronic bowling game, which uses body sensors for own actions of the game. Interactions were performed by a group of four students from a public school in Brazil, in order to perform mathematical activities with the Sports game on Xbox One with Kinect. Mathematically, the students discussed issues related to angulation, velocity, position relative to an axis and correlated to their digital being (game avatar) controlled by their biological body. In this sense, we are drawing up on embodied cognition articulated with the conceptions of perception and body-proper arising from the phenomenological view discussed by Merleau-Ponty. We understand that students' perception is shown by the acts of being-with, thinking-with and knowing-doing-mathematically-with-Digital-Technologies. Nevertheless, the perception of the body- proper opens up horizons of knowledge constitution that are not commonly seen in the mathematics classroom. © 2020 City University of New York.

Drama in education has the potential to increase motivation and interest in school science. Purpose: The study examined the impact of immersive drama on knowledge about biological classification and attitudes towards plants. The drama workshop, informed by the life of eighteenth century biologist Linnaeus, included inquiry-based learning with living plants. Sample: Four primary schools in Devon, UK were recruited for the study and a total of 108 students (aged 10–11 years) took part. Design and Methods: A mixed methods approach was adopted. Quantitative analysis of pre- and post-intervention knowledge and attitudinal assessment was combined with qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews which made use of emerging theme analysis with a priori categories. Results: Pre- and post-intervention tests indicated increases in knowledge as well as positive attitudes towards plants. Questionnaires and interviews identified elements that were particularly beneficial for learning and enjoyment, namely the sensorial experiences with plants, physical drama games, authentic problem-solving activities and the overall participatory nature of the workshop. Conclusions: The drama workshop produced measurable positive gains in learning and attitudes in school science. The participatory aspects of the drama and the experiences with live plants, contributed to the successful outcomes of the study. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

This paper contributes to the literature on data science education by examining the sociotechnical practices of data wrangling—strategies for selecting and managing large, aggregated datasets to produce a model and story. We examined the learning opportunities related to data wrangling practices by investigating youth’s talk-in-interaction while assembling models and stories about family migration using interactive data visualization tools and large socioeconomic datasets. We first identified ten sociotechnical practices that characterize youth’s interaction with tools and collaboration in data wrangling. We then suggest four categories of activities to describe patterns of learning related to the practices, including addressing missing data, understanding data aggregation, exploring social or historical events that constitute the formation of data patterns, and varying data visual encoding for storytelling. These practices and activities are important to understand for supporting future data science education opportunities that facilitate learning and discussion about scientific and socioeconomic issues. This study also sheds light on how the family migration modeling context positions the youth as having agency and authority over the data and contributes to the design of CSCL environments that tackle the challenges of data wrangling. © 2020, International Society of the Learning Sciences, Inc.},

Quantitative results showed that, while students’ cognitive load was not differentiated, students in the digital intervention outperformed their counterparts in terms of learning gains and emotional engagement.

Twenty-two students from a mixed first- and second-grade classroom participated in a seven-part activity sequence in the STEP environment. The authors applied interaction analysis to analyze how student’s actions performed with the physical objects helped them to construct liminal blends that allowed key concepts to be made visible and shared for collective sensemaking. Findings: The authors found that conceptually productive liminal blends occurred when students constructed connections between the resources in the MR environment and coordinated their embodiment with props to represent new understandings.

The aim of this article is to investigate teachers’ positioning and perspectives with respect to the activities and the educational environment emerging around the Geombot in the action research. The action research meetings between September 2018 and June 2019 included nine primary school teachers from seven different Italian schools, who met regularly with the first author. After the design and experimentation sessions, in June 2019, the teachers shared their experiences during a final meeting and group discussion guided by the first author. The data collected from the teachers were analyzed using cultural categories from the Semiotic Systems of Cultural Signification, theorized by the Theory of Objectification, to identify the most significant features defining the teachers’ perspectives and identity. The seven emergent features cover teachers’ positioning with respect to: forms of rationality and language and languages: sensuous cognition and the use of ideal and material semiotic resources; accepted teaching practices, problems and situations; mathematical knowledge; the conception of the student; social interaction and forms of rationality; ethical issues; technology. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: This paper compares the effects of two classroom-based technology-enhanced teaching interventions, conducted in two schools in sixth (age 11–12) grade. In one school, the intervention involves the use of a class set of 3D Printing Pens, and in another school the use of dynamic geometry environments, for inquiry-based learning of the relations among the number of vertices, edges, and faces of prisms and pyramids. An instrument was designed as guided by the van Hiele model of geometric thinking and administered to the two groups in the form of pretests, posttests, and delayed posttests to assess students’ prior knowledge before the intervention started, the learning outcomes obtained immediately after intervention, and the retention of knowledge after the interventions had been completed for a sustained period of time. The purpose of this study is to explore differences in geometry learning outcomes in two technology-enhanced environments, one that involves dynamic, visual representations of geometry and another that involves embodied actions of constructing physical 3D solids. Results: The results show that students using dynamic geometry improved at a higher rate than those using 3D Pens. On the other hand, students with the aid of 3D Pens demonstrated better retention of the properties of 3D solids than their dynamic geometry counterparts. Namely, the posttest results show that the dynamic geometry environment (DGE) group generally outperformed the 3D Pen group across categories. The observed outperformance by the DGE group on “advanced” implies that the DGE technology had a stronger effect on higher levels of geometric learning. However, the results from the ANCOVA suggest that the retention effect was more significant with 3D Pens. Conclusions: This study has established evidence that the DGE instructions produced strong but relatively temporary geometry learning outcomes, while 3D Pen instructions can help solidify that knowledge. The results of this study further shed light on the effect of visual and sensory-motor experiences on school mathematics learning and corroborate previous work showing that the effects of gesture are particularly good at promoting long-lasting learning. © 2020, The Author(s).},

This paper aims to revisit the notion of deliberative collaboration by revisiting Dewey’s curriculum theories. As part of a series of design-based research, this qualitative case study reports collaborative learning processes among a group of five Singapore astronomy amateurs with the facilitator in a multimodal modeling workshop. Through the lens of Cultural-Historical Activity Theory, two contradictions were defined as a driving force to co-construct their conceptual understanding of distance and size of celestial objects and co-design multimodal models.

However, no significant differences were found between media for procedural knowledge in Experiment 1 and 2, or transfer in Experiment 2. Also, there was no difference in declarative knowledge across media in Experiment 1, and there was a media effect favoring video in Experiment 2 (ηp² = 0.028). Enactment lead to significantly better procedural knowledge (ηp² = 0.144) and transfer (ηp² = 0.088) in the IVR group but not in the video group. In conclusion, learning in IVR is not more effective than learning with video but incorporating generative learning strategies is specifically effective when learning through IVR. The results suggest that the value of IVR for learning science depends on how it is integrated into a classroom lesson.

	abstract = {Previous research has established that embodied modeling (role-playing agents in a system) can support learning about complexity. Separately, research has demonstrated that increasing the multimodal resources available to students can support sensemaking, particularly for students classified as English Learners. This study bridges these two bodies of research to consider how embodied models can strengthen an interconnected system of multimodal models created by a classroom. We explore how iteratively refining embodied modeling activities strengthened connections to other models, real-world phenomena, and multimodal representations. Through design-based research in a sixth grade classroom studying ecosystems, we refined embodied modeling activities initially conceived as supports for computational thinking and modeling. Across three iterative cycles, we illustrate how the conceptual and epistemic relationship between the computational and embodied model shifted, and we analyze how these shifts shaped opportunities for learning and participation by: (1) recognizing each student’s perspectives as critical for making sense of the model, (2) encouraging students to question and modify the “code” for the model, and (3) leveraging multimodal resources, including graphs, gestures, and student-generated language, for meaning-making. Through these shifts, the embodied model became a full-fledged component of the classroom’s model system and created more equitable opportunities for learning and participation. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to advance the proposal to use immersive virtual learning environments to stimulate and reveal deep-seated knowledge about science, giving instructors and researchers unique possibilities for assessing and identifying intuitive physical science knowledge. Aside from the ability to present rich and dynamic stimuli, these environments afford bodily enactment of people’s understanding, which draws less from declarative knowledge stores and more from everyday experiences with the physical world. Design/methodology/approach: The authors ground their proposal in a critical review of the impact of stimulus and task characteristics of traditional physics inventories. Using a grounded theory approach, the authors present classifications and interpretations of observed bodily enactments of physics understandings in a study where participants enacted their understanding of force and motion of space in an immersive, interactive mixed reality (MR) environment. Findings: The authors find that instances of these action categories can be interpreted as relating to underlying knowledge, often identified by other studies. The authors thus replicate a number of prior findings, which provide evidence to establish validation for using MR simulation as a tool for identifying people’s physical intuitions. Research limitations/implications: This study targeted only a few specific physical science scenarios. Further, while a number of key insights about student knowledge came from the analysis, many of the observations are mere leads in need of further investigation and interpretation rather than core findings. Originality/value: Immersive digital learning environments are primarily used for instruction. The authors propose to use and design them for assessment as well.

	abstract = {Given growing interest in K-12 data and data science education, new approaches are needed to help students develop robust understandings of and familiarity with data. The model of the quantified self—in which data about one’s own activities are collected and made into objects of study—provides inspiration for one such approach. By drawing on what one already knows about their self and their prior experiences, it may be possible to bootstrap students’ abilities to interpret and make sense of data. Taking that possibility seriously, this article describes some of the gains observed in students’ statistical reasoning following a quantified self, wearables-based elementary statistics unit and provides a theoretical framework drawing from cognitive psychology, embodiment, and situative perspectives to characterize how prior experience is used as a resource in data sense-making when the data are about students’ own physical experiences. This framework centralizes and interrogates the work of “remembering” prior experiences and articulates how remembering is involved in interpreting quantified self data. Specifically, the framework emphasizes that remembering in service of data interpretation is a reconstructive act that draws from both general and specific embodied resources and that the work of reconstructive remembering in the classroom is both individual and multi-participant work. To demonstrate measured learning gains and illustrate the framework, written assessment results and descriptive cases of student and teacher discussions about quantified self data from two sixth-grade classes participating in a classroom design experiment are provided. Both a discussion of and recommendations for ethical considerations related to quantified self data in education are also provided. © 2021 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

This stamp kit is a versatile teaching and learning tool that can be used for embodied simulations (i.e. simulations using tangible materials and/or bodily movements) of DNA-replication and protein synthesis. Teachers have also started using the DNA stamp kit and accompanying DNA font to develop embodied simulations of other genetic and epigenetic processes, such as DNA-methylation and genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9. During these simulations, students typically play the role of enzymes, and are responsible for the manipulation of physical representations of biological structures in their own interpersonal space. A questionnaire completed by 56 teachers suggests that simulations with the DNA stamp kit (a) increase students’ motivation, (b) increase students’ understanding, (c) reveal misconceptions and facilitate formative assessment, and (d) help students to remember the simulated processes. Video recordings and student evaluations of eight lessons with the stamp kit provide preliminary evidence supporting these claims.

A prototype of the initial TM was implemented and evaluated using mixed methods (i.e., classroom interventions, paper-based tests, thinking aloud sessions, questionnaires, and interviews) in real classroom settings. Six teachers, 24 primary school students, and 65 lower secondary school students participated in the exploratory study. The quantitative and qualitative analysis revealed that the initial TM supported student learning at various levels and had a positive impact on their learning achievement. Moreover, its overall usability was also accepted. Some minor improvements with regard to its pedagogy and usability could be implemented. These findings indicate that the initial TM is likely to be beneficial for linear equation learning in pre-primary to lower secondary schools and be usable in mathematics classrooms.

The interplay of students’ playful exploration through physical engagement with the simulation environment, their attention to physics concepts and laws, and knowledge about the real planets orbiting the Sun presents an analytical challenge for the researcher and instructor encountering such complex learning environments. We argue that the framework of conceptual blending is particularly apt for dealing with the learning environment at hand, because it allows us to take into account the many diverse mental inputs that seem to shape the student activities described in the paper.

All grade 10 students in a French high school (the lycée Condorcet, Val de Marne) participated in two successive teaching-learning sessions, designed within the theoretical framework of embodied cognition. The learning material consisted of two versions of a spatiotemporal aspect map of the Solar System that allowed students to enact and observe trajectories from different points of view. The first was a printed, paper model (PO) that was used individually on a table. The other was a human version (HO). Thus, students enacted movements with either their fingers (PO) or their bodies (HO). Both sessions (HO or PO) used the same activities to illustrate the movements of Earth, Mars, and the Sun during a 24-h and 1-yr period, observed from different reference frames (terrestrial, geocentric, or heliocentric). Students' conceptual understanding was tested using a questionnaire, which was administrated before and after each session, and three months later. The questionnaire described three situations in which the motion of an object is observed from two different points of view. We expected students to understand that speed and distance traveled were different in both cases. Our initial results suggest that the sessions did have a significant and lasting effect on students' understanding of the dependence of motions on reference frames. While the degree of embodiment (HO or PO) does not seem to affect conceptual learning, the abstract operation of moving from one reference frame to another is facilitated when one has physically and repeatedly lived it.  © 2021 authors.

Identifying the biological provenance of mathematical thinking would bear on education, because we could then design learning environments that simulate ecologically authentic conditions for leveraging this universal phylogenetic inclination. The ancient mechanism coopted for mathematical activity, I propose, is our fundamental organismic capacity to improve our sensorimotor engagement with the environment by detecting, generating, and maintaining goal-oriented perceptual structures regulating action, whether actual or imaginary. As such, the phenomenology of grasping a mathematical notion is literally that - gripping the environment in a new way that promotes interaction. To argue for the plausibility of my thesis, I first survey embodiment literature to implicate cognition as constituted in perceptuomotor engagement. Then, I summarize findings from a design-based research project investigating relations between learning to move in new ways and learning to reason mathematically about these conceptual choreographies. As such, the project proposes educational implications of enactivist evolutionary biology.  © 2021 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

It is important, then, to find methodological alternatives that allow the parallel development of arithmetical and algebraic thinking from the first years of learning. This article begins with a review of a series of theoretical foundations that support a methodological proposal based on the use of specific manipulative materials that foster a deep knowledge of the decimal number system, while verbalizing and representing quantitative situations that underline numerical relationships and properties and patterns of num-bers. Developing and illustrating this approach is the main purpose of this paper. The proposal has been implemented in a group of 25 pupils in the first year of primary school. Some observed mile-stones are presented and analyzed. In the light of the results, this well-planned early intervention contains key elements to initiate algebraic thinking through the development of number sense, nat-urally enhancing the translation of purely arithmetical situations into the symbolic language characteristic of algebraic thinking. © 2021 by the authors.

To date, little is known about reference frames used by young children in toy-based coding. Video recordings of 16 children engaging in two programming tasks were collected. Results from an analysis of 240 min of video data indicate that young children engage in shifts of reference frames when learning to program, however, young children do not have a precise coordination system. The present study proposes two additional reference frames, ProtoEgocentric and ProtoAllocentric, that allow for the consideration of developmental imprecision in children. The most common reference frame shift observed was ProtoAllocentric to ProtoEgocentric, which accounted for 47.4\% of all shifts across sites and contexts. Three cases are presented to illustrate reference frame shifts and how children's developmental imprecision affects their experience. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

The present case study covers the design, implementation and evaluation of a multidisciplinary unit in a Finnish lower secondary school, grade 9. The entire multidisciplinary unit was organized around the central concept of energy, and the present study focuses on an activity within that unit that explored how energy can be used to analyze both living and non-living systems. Evaluation of the activity was done with pre and post student questionnaires, analyzing the students' written poster presentations and focus group interviews done with a voluntary group of students after the whole unit. The aim of the study was to explore how students understand the multidisciplinary character of the energy concept. Our results show both challenges and possible gains of working in a multidisciplinary way. However, to succeed serious thought has to be invested in both identifying core concepts that gain by being analyzed in an interdisciplinary way, and in the design of appropriate learning activities around these core concepts.

	abstract = {Design thinking has an important role in STEM education. However, there has been limited research on how students engage in various modalities throughout the design process in hands-on design tasks. To promote middle school students’ engineering literacy, it is necessary to examine the use of design modalities during design. Using a case study approach, we examine middle school students’ design stages and modalities during design activities. We also identify the patterns of design processes in the teams with different design outcomes. Drawing on theories in design thinking and embodied interaction, we proposed a framework and devised a video analysis protocol to examine students’ design stages and modalities. Middle school students attending a design workshop engaged in two design activities in teams of 3–4 people. The design sessions were video recorded and analyzed using the video analysis protocol. The teams engaged in the stages of planning, building, and testing, while employing the verbal, the visual, and the physical modalities. The teams that varied in design outcomes exhibited different patterns in the use of multiple modalities during the design stages. This study contributes to research on design thinking by proposing a framework for analyzing middle school students’ multimodal design processes and presenting data visualization methods to identify patterns in design stages and modalities. The findings suggest the necessity to examine students’ use of design modalities in the context of design stages and imply the potential benefits of using multiple modalities during design. The implications for future research and education practices are also discussed. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Embodied cognition theories view sensorimotor activity as fundamental to learning, knowing, and reasoning. To investigate the role of physical movement in conceptual learning, we developed and explored an Embodied Learning Interactive Chemistry environment (ELI-Chem). The ELI-Chem learning environment includes a computer simulation, a device for interacting with the simulation, and an online activity guide. In particular, we focused on the topic of chemical bonding—an abstract and nonintuitive phenomenon that is crucial to chemistry learning and that presents pervasive problems in learning. The ELI-Chem learning environment embodies atoms' movement through four increasing degrees of bodily engagement in terms of range of motion and forces—movie, simulation, joystick, and haptic device (applies force feedback). A randomly assigned pretest-intervention-posttest four-group comparison design was used with a mixed-methods research approach. Quantitative analysis of pretest and posttest questionnaires tested the conceptual learning. Qualitative analysis of students' filled activity guides explored students' perceptions of the learning process and features of understanding. The participants were 48 high school chemistry students, 12 students in each degree of bodily engagement. During the activity, students were prompted to discover the forces underlying chemical bonding and to explore the energy changes involved. We found an increase in students' conceptual understanding in all four degrees of bodily engagement, with significantly higher learning gains and causal understanding in the haptic condition with a greater range of motion and forces. This study highlights the states in which embodied learning uniquely contributes to understanding and perception: absence of prior embodied experience, learning about a nonvisual concept related to forces, and a high congruence with the concept learned. © 2021 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.},

	abstract = {Materialist design is presented as an embodied perspective on educational design that can be applied to redesign of classroom-based learning environments. Materialist design is informed by a framework of materialist epistemology, which positions material innovation on equal placement with symbol-based formal theory. Historical examples of Einstein’s conceptual reliance on trains for his Theory of Relativity and the Wright brothers’ use of wind tunnels in aeronautics illustrate how materialist design drives progress on complex design problems. A key aspect is the application of scale-down methodology, where complex systems are reconceptualized as interactions among nearly decomposable subsystems that can be redesigned and integrated back into the entire system. The application of materialist design is illustrated with the redesign of an embodied video game that uses real-time motion capture technology to promote high school geometry reasoning and proof, following its use in an ethnically and linguistically diverse classroom. Our embodied perspective offers particular insights for understanding and implementing designs of complex learning environments, and assessing their influences on educational practices and student outcomes. © 2020, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.},

We present analysis of inquiry in action as 1st and 2nd graders oriented to exploring shared puzzles together using resources they deemed relevant in a Mixed-Reality learning environment. This environment privileged resources with which children were already familiar by inviting students to imagine being water particles and supporting them to explore how they needed to move together as particles to create different states of matter (solid, liquid, gas). By tracing students' sensemaking across several phases of inquiry while learning to make liquid together, we illustrate how students managed many challenges including those that were a result of having to embody the very phenomenon they were studying. We demonstrate learners' competent navigation of interactional challenges of making states together through collaborative choreographed movements and trace their embodied and conceptual accomplishments as they linked their motion as microscopic water particles to emergent creation of liquid water in the complex system. We draw on this analysis to suggest reconceptualizations of inquiry in the literature and to emphasize the need as researchers and educators to learn with and from children. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

In this study, we examined how gesturing with a computer simulation that depicts the molecular mechanism of thermal conduction supported middle-school students in constructing causal mechanistic explanations. We designed a gesture-augmented computer simulation in which students were cued to use hand gestures to control the simulation. These cued gestures represent core causal interactions of conduction and they prompt students to physically engage with the simulation in conceptually meaningful ways. In this study, we examined how 21 students used the simulation and explained thermal conduction in a semi-structured interview, followed by a mixed-methods analysis. Quantitative analysis shows that students moved toward articulating the canonical causal mechanistic explanation of thermal conduction using the simulation. Three representative cases were identified to explore how students' explanations were facilitated by cued gestures. The analysis shows two main ways the cued gestures supported all students in the study: (a) by helping them attribute causal agency to molecules rather than an entity called Heat, and (b) by reifying the core mechanism of molecular collisions in conduction. Furthermore, the case studies show how each student's unique ways of sensemaking impacted their gesture use. Implications for instruction with gestures and design of augmented environments are discussed. © 2021 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.},

The findings suggest that, for young children, computational thinking was extended to include the structures in the environment and guided by their embodiment of mathematical concepts. Specifically, the participants repeatedly used their bodies to simulate different possibilities for action while incorporating both perceptual and formal multiplicative reasoning strategies to conceptualize the robot’s movements.

We introduce an activity that transformed a data table into an embodied artifact. The activity helped 8th grade students interpret the data to find that cold water warmed “fast-then-slow,” in other words, that the rate of warming decreased over time. For the activity, students were invited to “act out” the temperature change by walking along a giant horizontal thermometer while their classmates clapped out the passage of time. To arrive at the correct temperature at the right time, students had to continually slow their pace. We offer a microgenetic analysis of the activity to illuminate how it helped participating students notice that the cold water’s temperature warmed fast-then-slow, developing an account of the students’ passage from action to understanding. We argue that embodied representations can be effectively coupled with tools and traditional symbolic systems to make abstract concepts more accessible, opening an alternative route for students to engage in rich mathematical reasoning and scientific sense-making. © 2021, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.},

Based on initial interviews to understand the specific needs and interests of the steppers, we developed some early prototypes for visual and acoustic analysis, concentrating on pose precision, tempo, and spectral characteristics (timbre) for. Teacher and student reactions to the tools demonstrated support for our hypotheses that off-line embodied cognition would help with new knowledge acquisition and that the perceived usefulness of data science would motivate learning.

As a consequence, we can only understand many processes that drive geological phenomena through analogical reasoning. Building deep conceptual understanding requires instruction that activates the appropriate source analogs and allows students to build useful conceptual metaphors. In this paper we illustrate, using plate tectonics as an example, how educational guidelines for teaching geosciences can be developed by linking the Model of Educational Reconstruction with Conceptual Metaphor Theory. Qualitative content analysis in combination with systematic metaphor analysis of scientific textbooks and semi-structured interviews conducted with students (n = 36) provided insight into the image schemas used by scientists and learners. Difficulties in understanding plate tectonics structures and processes, e.g. subduction, arise because many students understand tectonic plates as single bodies, rather than composites. Similarly, students’ difficulties explaining plate movement result from activation of a push rather than a pull schema. Through exploring schemas for plate tectonics, we illustrate the value of combining Conceptual Metaphor Theory and the Model of Educational Reconstruction for (1) understanding alternative conceptions as grounded in image schemas and (2) developing educational guidelines for improving instruction. © 2021 National Association of Geoscience Teachers.},

By ignoring issues of body, ethnicity and culture, these framings limit access to physics for many, including Black girls, who struggle to gain access to physics. Studying the situated, embodied cultural practices of Black girls in physics learning environments provides a window into the range of resources available for physics exploration and illuminates possibilities for culturally relevant physics pedagogies. Methods: We engaged in micro-ethnographic analysis of video of youth actions and interactions during collaborative activities that combined dance and dance-making practices with physics content. Findings: Our findings show how (1) dance offered an embodied lens for physics investigation; (2) positioning movement as inquiry gave dancers access to an expanded vocabulary for sense-making; and (3) dance provided opportunities to bring in social and cultural resources as critical funds of knowledge. Contributions: This article expands the view of funds of knowledge by reintroducing the body, movement, and embodied interaction as resources for learning and engagement and offers an expanded view of physics sense-making that includes cultural embodied resources and foregrounds Black girls, whose voices and experiences are often left out of learning research. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, these shorthand assessments become dangerous because they constrain disciplinary knowledge, and limiting one’s identity and capabilities remains antithetical to broad education goals. Capitalizing on dance as a situated, embodied form of knowledge, as well as an engaging, interactive, and social endeavor, we facilitate instruction that uses a dance-based approach to teach geometric transformations in a teacher education program. In this paper, we discuss findings from a case study intervention in a graduate-level geometry education course where we engaged participants in this transformations dance activity. We ask: What disciplinary practices did participants use in a dance-based intervention on geometric transformations? And, how did they use them? We found that the parallel disciplinary practices that the participants engaged in, in dance and mathematics, sheds light on a need in education to resist binary identities and to encourage inquiry-based practices. We aim to inspire future professional development and collaborative teaching opportunities for dance teachers in math and math teachers in dance, along with research that investigates intersections of learning, practice, and identity, particularly in dance + math. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

The screen recording allowed us to (re)view the students’ touches in two simultaneous sources (audio and interactions on screen), using the same application.

However, there are very few studies that focus on the learning processes that take place when teachers and students attend to tools and machines as a vocational learning content in workshop teaching sessions. This article aims to shed light on these processes by exploring how tools and machines are constituted through the interaction between vocational teachers and students in Swedish upper secondary vocational education. Leaning on the theoretical and methodological framework CAVTA (Conversational Analysis and Variation Theory Approach) when analysing video-recorded lessons, the study shows that the teaching about tools and machines takes place as a result of suddenly emerging problems that the students encounter. The study also shows that the teaching about tools and machines is conducted through the framing method of individualization, which leads to situations in which some students are given the opportunity to learn specific things about tools and machines, and others are not, even within the same session. © 2022 The Author(s).

Further research may also serve to clarify how underrepresented students construct knowledge over time and make sense of embodied STEM learning experiences. In order to encourage engagement with science education, the four-week Science Through Sports summer curriculum was designed and implemented at a middle school located in an economically underrepresented urban area. The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to explore 15 middle school students' attitudes toward science, design thinking, and computational thinking as a result of engaging in Science Through Sports. Findings revealed growth in students attitudes toward science and science identities, as well as development of skills, self-efficacy, and knowledge in relation to science, sports, computational thinking, and design thinking. © 2022 Eskisehir Osmangazi University.

Results showed that embodied planning activities benefited these young learners’ LEGO Robotics problem-solving and self-determination skills. Based on these findings, a second study implemented different types of embodied activities (full-embody, low-embody, and control condition) in a debugging problem-solving activity for 51 kindergarten and 1st-grade students, also from ethnically diverse populations. The findings from this study suggested that the embodied learning activities promoted students’ problem-solving skills in robotics and the use of debugging strategies in coding applications. However, different effects were found for groups by condition and the outcome variable. Based on these mixed results, the authors propose activities applicable in real-world elementary classrooms to introduce practical robotics and programming activities. © 2022 Childhood Education International.},

	abstract = {Mechanistic reasoning is a powerful form of reasoning central to scientific explanations. Despite mechanistic reasoning being an important dimension of scientific practice and a central dimension of science curricula, students face difficulties in developing such type of reasoning. Many authors have been proposing tools for supporting its development; drawing is one such tool. Studies that purposefully explore how drawing leverages and supports students' mechanistic reasoning while engage in a process of constructing explanations are still scarce. The goal of the current study was to understand how students' mechanistic reasoning emerges and is enacted when students are jointly involved in drawing creation. For that, we drew on a recent framework that identifies essential characteristics of students' mechanistic reasoning and also on theories of distributed and embodied cognition. In this paper, we present a pair of middle school students who jointly explain a chemical phenomenon by creating drawings and reasoning with them. Using a fine-grain analysis we examined the elements of students' mechanistic reasoning in relation to drawing creation and how talk and embodied actions on and with the drawings were used to support students' reasoning. Findings reveal that drawings played a key role in paving the way for students reasoning about mechanisms and in enacting mechanistic reasoning. In particular, drawings were essential for pushing students to look for a mechanism, for enabling and supporting mechanistic reasoning-in-action, and for facilitating productive interactions between the students that ended up in the construction of a sophisticated mechanistic explanation. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

	abstract = {Drawing is recognized as a powerful tool to learn science. Although current research has enriched our understanding of the potential of learning through drawing, scarce attention has been given to the social-cognitive interactions that occur when students jointly create drawings to understand and explain phenomena in science. This article is based on the distributed and embodied cognition theories and it adopted the notion of we-space, defined as a complex social-cognitive space, dynamically established and managed during the ongoing interactions of the individuals, when they manipulate and exploit a shared space. The goal of the study was to explore the role that collaborative drawing plays in shaping the social-cognitive interaction among students. We examine this by a fine-grain multimodal analysis of a pair of middle school students, who jointly attempted to understand and explain a chemical phenomenon by creating drawings and thinking with them. Our findings suggest that collaborative drawing played a key role in (i) establishing a genuine shared-action space, a we-space, and that within this we-space it had two major functions: (ii) enabling collective thinking-in-action and (iii) simplifying communication. We argue that drawing, as a joint activity, has a potential for learning, not restricted to the cognitive process related to the activity of creating external visual representations on paper; instead, the benefits of drawing lie in action in space. Creating these representations is more than a process of externalization of thought: it is part of a process of collective thinking-in-action. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: The theory of embodied cognition claims that body interaction with the environment change how we think and constitute cognition. Accordingly, active learning enriches learning experiences which in turn lead to better learning. Purpose: Although learning by moving one’s body is often regarded as active learning, not all body movements lead to better learning. To investigate the influence of different levels of body movements on learning, we developed embodied learning activities and implemented in elementary afterschool program. Sample: Twenty-seven fifth graders (12 girls, 15 boys) for Study 1 and forty-eight fifth graders (28 girls, 20 boys) for Study 2 were recruited from afterschool programs from two public elementary schools. Design and methods: Through two quasi-experimental studies, we compared student learning and their attitude about physics concepts. Study 1 compared learning and attitude between two groups of students depending on whether body movements correspond to knowledge representation embedded in a to-be-learned concept (congruent condition) or not (incongruent condition). In Study 2, a control group that did not engage in body movement-related learning activities, was added to observe the impact of body movement itself. Therefore, students in three groups (congruent, incongruent, no body movement group) were compared in their learning and attitude. Results: The results from Study 1 showed that the students in the congruent group showed better learning and higher attitude in science learning than those in the incongruent groups. Study 2 showed that the congruent group showed better learning and higher attitude than other groups. Also, there was no learning difference between the incongruent group and the control group. Conclusion: The studies showed that the students could benefit from the embodied lesson plan and the findings imply that a student’s movements are to be elaborated and mindful considering knowledge representations embedded in a concept. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Computational thinking is a fundamental competence that is being introduced in K-12 and succeeding curricula worldwide. Despite this huge effort, many computational thinking models in the literature do not explicitly take into consideration the pupils’ age and the developmental nature of computational thinking skills. Furthermore, many existing computational thinking models are focused on the internal thinking processes of the individuals, failing to explicitly consider the situated nature, in terms of social context and artefactual environment, that usually characterise tasks that require computational thinking to be solved. In this paper, we present a framework for the design, realisation, analysis, and assessment of computational thinking activities, called CT-cube. The CT-cube allows to extend existing computational thinking models to consider the life-long development of computational thinking skills in individuals, from childhood to adult age, and to take into consideration the situated nature of computational thinking activities. We use the CT-cube to design an unplugged task, called Cross Array Task (CAT), allowing to assess the algorithmic skills of K-12 pupils and we show how the CT-cube can be used in this case to illustrate the development of this competence along the entire compulsory school path, considering a sample of 109 pupil aged 3 to 16 in Switzerland. © 2022 The Author(s)},

Results show that students' CT skills followed a developmental progression before instruction. Gender difference across ages was insignificant in conditionals, logical operators, pattern recognition and generalization skills. Additionally, students of different ages developed CT differently during the intervention, and their CT acquisition was unaffected by gender.

The experiences of preservice science teachers’ drama facilitation were explored in two cases, in which they designed and facilitated drama activities for high school students (13-15 years old). The PSSTs in both cases read a story to students, who were then given roles related to that story. The data consists of in-depth interviews with the PSSTs. In the interviews concerning their experiences, the PSSTs were found to to recognize science learning opportunities and challenges while taking care of student inclusion and showing sensitivity towards students’ emotional expressions.

This study describes a learning intervention designed to afford participants opportunities to experience the diffusion of a (virtual) virus within a community, albeit in a safe way. The intervention was enacted in March 2021 among nine undergraduate teachers-in-training at a teacher-education institute in Singapore. Participants were invited to reflect on the connections between their personal decision-making and its impact on the broader community, after having first undertaken a collaborative task in a virtual environment. The Socially Responsible Behavior through Embodied Thinking (SORBET) Project draws on the learning sciences in terms of embodied cognition and projective identity, and in this study, seeks to apply them to geographical understandings of diffusion. Responses from post-activity interviews are reported along three themes, as structured by the cultural–historical activity theory. Through encouraging reflection on authentic experience, the authors hope to catalyze a more grounded appreciation of the need to practice positive social habits in the context of a pandemic and by extension, contribute to the fight against the virus through the application of geographical thinking at local and global scales.

As a group of researchers working in elementary Initial Teacher Education in English universities, we co-planned and taught sessions on growing pattern generalisation. Following the sessions, interviews of fifteen preservice teachers at two universities focused on their expressed awareness of their approach to the mathematical activity. Preservice teachers’ prospective planning and post-teaching evaluations of similar activities in their classrooms were also examined. We draw on aspects of enactivism and the notion of reflective “spection” in the context of teacher learning, tracing threads between preservice teachers’ retro-spection of learning and pro-spection of teaching. Our analysis indicates that increasing sensitivity to their own embodied processes of generalisation offers opportunities for novice teachers to respond deliberately, rather than to react impulsively, to different pedagogical possibilities. The paper contributes a new dimension to the discussion about the focus of novice elementary school teachers’ retrospective reflection by examining how deliberate retrospective analysis of doing mathematics, and not only of teaching actions, can develop awarenesses that underlie the growth of expertise in mathematics teaching. We argue that engaging preservice teachers in mathematics to support deliberate retrospective analysis of their mathematics learning and prospective consideration of the implications for teaching can enable more critical pedagogical choices. © 2021, The Author(s).},

In particular, the use of digital tools in mathematics education affects the meaning-making processes. This paper discusses meaning-making from a phenomenological standpoint, in which interpretative activities are relevant. This approach requires a careful analysis of the semiotic resources’ evolution, including those related to the used digital tools. The paper aims to introduce an analytical tool, the Timeline. This tool is an elaboration on previous analysis tools, like the interaction flowchart and the semiotic bundle. Such a tool allows the analysis of relationship among interactions, semiotic resources, and meaning-making. In this paper, the Timeline is used to analyze two episodes from two different learning experiments where GeoGebra and augmented reality are used. High school students from Italy and Israel participated in this study. Video recording has been used to document the entire learning experiments. The analysis provides evidence that the Timeline enables investigating the relationship between students-teacher-artifacts interactions and meaning-making. Moreover, results may give teachers ideas for using digital tools to foster students’ meaning-making. © The Author(s) 2022.},

However, access to laboratories might not always be available to students. Therefore, it is advantageous to diversify the tools that students could use to train practical skills. This technology report describes the design, development, and first testing of a mobile augmented reality application that enables a hands-on learning experience of a titration experiment. Additionally, it presents the extension of the TrainAR framework for chemical education through the implementation of specific domain features, i.e., logbook, graph, and practical oriented hints. To test the application, 15 participants were recruited from five different high schools and two universities in Belgium. The findings reflect that the MAR Lab app was well-received by the users. In addition, they valued the design elements (e.g., logbook and multiple-choice questions), and the system has "good"usability (SUS score 72.8, SD = 14.0). Nevertheless, the usability and learners' experience can be improved by tackling technical problems, providing more explicit instructions for subtasks, and modifying certain features. Therefore, future development will concentrate on improving upon these shortcomings, adding additional levels to target a larger audience, and evaluating the improvements' effects with more participants. © Published 2022 by American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

Yet research has documented student difficulties in moving beyond rote procedures. This fine-grained study with Year 10 (15 or 16-year-old) students sought insights into how visualization and pair-work interactions might be harnessed for highlighting conceptual connections among quadratic concepts. Theorizations of symbolic generalization and student noticing were drawn on to investigate two pairs working on 19 quadratic generalization tasks. Different visual structures were found to elicit both productive and unproductive actions. Productive actions included building on each other's visualizations, explaining disagreements verbally and with gestures, and verifying each other's generalizations. Some unproductive actions were found that shifted focus away from symbolic generalization. An emergent framework to inform participative approaches to learning algebra is shared, along with suggested implications for including figural patterns when teaching quadratics and suggestions for further research. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The transfer of knowledge among academic subjects and linking different phenomena are crucial education competencies in Bloom's taxonomy of learning goals. From another side, modern cognitive science defines cognition and learning as embodied. The Synthetic Understanding through Movement Analogies (SUMA) educational framework proposes embodied learning of general scientific principles and concepts and knowledge transfer among academic disciplines encompassing sciences, humanities and arts. Accordingly, this research aimed to evaluate the educational potential of teaching a set of Dynamic Systems Theory (DST) concepts through body movement experiences in first-grade high school students. Five classes of high school students (n = 71; 23 girls, 46 boys and 2 non-binaries, aged 12–13 y.) followed a four-week intervention addressed to teaching five DST concepts (order parameter, stability, control parameter, instability and phase transition) and transfer them to biological and social phenomena. Students followed four teaching phases: a) embodied experience, b) reflective observation of the experience, c) abstract conceptualization of the experience using the five general concepts, d) transfer of knowledge through the concepts to different phenomena from biological and social science academic subjects. Students' integration and transfer of knowledge abilities were evaluated pre- and post-intervention through a questionnaire and three open-ended questions. Results were compared using non-parametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs test and effect sizes were calculated through PS dep measures. Students' abilities to integrate and transfer knowledge increased post-intervention (Z = 7.322, p {\textless} 0.0001, PSdep = 1). The effect of the intervention points to the potential of teaching general DST concepts through body movement experiences in high school students for achieving the goals of an embodied and unificatory transdisciplinary education. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Argumentation as a scientific practice has largely been examined along an epistemic and/or dialogic perspective in science education research. Both perspectives have sidelined the use of real material objects that are indispensable for scientists to construct arguments about the natural world. To address this gap, this article investigates how material objects are used to coordinate with our speech and actions to shape argumentation in secondary physical science. Drawing on actor-network theory, the article reframes argumentation as a chain of human-material interactions incorporating the role of physical things to construct evidence. Based on a collective case study comprising classroom video data generated from two grade nine science classrooms, the article examines how teachers and students used material objects to engage in argumentation related to qualitative analysis in chemistry and Newton's laws of motions in physics. The analysis reveals two major themes: (a) material inquiry as the framing of questions and statements about the behavior or property of the material world and (b) material transformation as the orchestration of material objects, embodied actions, and words to actively create evidence. This article concludes that both material inquiry and material transformation are essential prerequisites for scientific argumentation to take place, not only in research laboratories, but also in science classrooms. The contribution to the development of a future socio-material theory of scientific argumentation, which takes material agency and multimodal discourse into account, are also discussed. © 2022 The Author.

	abstract = {This paper reports from a case study which explores kindergarten children’s mathematical abstraction in a teaching–learning activity about reflection symmetry. From a dialectical perspective, abstraction is here conceived as a process, as a genuine part of human activity, where the learner establishes “a point of view from which the concrete can be seen as meaningfully related” (van Oers \& Poland Mathematics Education Research Journal, 19(2), 10–22, 2007, p. 13–14). A cultural-historical semiotic perspective to embodiment is used to explore the characteristics of kindergarten children’s mathematical abstraction. In the selected segment, two 5-year-old boys explore the concept of reflection symmetry using a doll pram. In the activity, the two boys first point to concrete features of the sensory manifold, then one of the boys’ awareness gradually moves to the imagined and finally to grasping a general and establishing a new point of view. The findings illustrate the essential role of gestures, bodily actions, and rhythm, in conjunction with spoken words, in the two boys’ gradual process of grasping a general. The study advances our knowledge about the nature of mathematical abstraction and challenges the traditional view on abstraction as a sort of decontextualised higher order thinking. This study argues that abstraction is not a matter of going from the concrete to the abstract, rather it is an emergent and context-bound process, as a genuine part of children’s concrete embodied activities. © 2021, The Author(s).},

With a specific activity, we integrated a class of prospective kindergarten and primary school teachers on electric circuits with a reflection on the cognitive and linguistic aspects of metaphor. To understand how effective this integration proved to be, both in terms of learning and in terms of developing teaching skills, we conducted a single case study with a mixed qualitative–quantitative methodol-ogy. Student teachers were invited to analyze and discuss expressions on electric circuits selected from those they themselves had formulated at an earlier time. Here, we present some relevant results from the analysis of the students’ elaborations, highlighting how they worked with metaphors. They demonstrated a better understanding of the subject matter and greater awareness of teaching as well, in particular for what concerns the use of language and identifying and overcoming implicit ideas. © 2022 by the authors.

Upper arm wearables were used as an objective tool to compare three approaches when teaching science: (i) classical frontal teaching, (ii) embodied (kinesthetic) teaching, and (iii) a distance teaching approach. Using the wearables, the approaches were compared in terms of their impact on students’ psychological arousal and perceived well-being. In addition, short-term and long-term knowledge gain and physiological synchronization between teacher and students during the lecture were assessed. A synchronization index was defined to estimate the degree of physiological synchronization. During distance teaching, by means of measurements with wearables, students were significantly less physically active and significantly less psychologically aroused. Embodied teaching allowed significantly higher physical activation than during the other two approaches. The synchronization index for all three teaching approaches was positive with the highest values for distance and frontal teaching. Moreover, knowledge gain immediately after the embodied lessons was higher than after frontal lessons. No significant differences in the long-term knowledge retention between the three different teaching methods were found. This pilot study proved that wearables are a useful tool in research in the field of education and have the potential to contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in learning, even in complex environments such as an elementary school classroom. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {It is well known that primary school children may face difficulties in acquiring mathematical competence, possibly because teaching is generally based on formal lessons with little opportunity to exploit more multisensory-based activities within the classroom. To overcome such difficulties, we report here the exemplary design of a novel multisensory learning environment for teaching mathematical concepts based on meaningful inputs from elementary school teachers. First, we developed and administered a questionnaire to 101 teachers asking them to rate based on their experience the learning difficulty for specific arithmetical and geometrical concepts encountered by elementary school children. Additionally, the questionnaire investigated the feasibility to use multisensory information to teach mathematical concepts. Results show that challenging concepts differ depending on children school level, thus providing a guidance to improve teaching strategies and the design of new and emerging learning technologies accordingly. Second, we obtained specific and practical design inputs with workshops involving elementary school teachers and children. Altogether, these findings are used to inform the design of emerging multimodal technological applications, that take advantage not only of vision but also of other sensory modalities. In the present work, we describe in detail one exemplary multisensory environment design based on the questionnaire results and design ideas from the workshops: the Space Shapes game, which exploits visual and haptic/proprioceptive sensory information to support mental rotation, 2D–3D transformation and percentages. Corroborating research evidence in neuroscience and pedagogy, our work presents a functional approach to develop novel multimodal user interfaces to improve education in the classroom. © 2021, The Author(s).},

We present affordances of integrating theories of embodied cognition and design with machine-learning methods to study student learning in mathematics and inform the design of embodied learning activities. By increasing such collaborative research efforts, learning scientists can incorporate regularization in computational models and ultimately draw reliable conclusions to further inform theory and practice through the design of technology-augmented learning activities. To illustrate this point, we explored students’ conceptual understanding of measurement since limited research has identified measurement estimation strategies that should be emphasized in classroom instruction. By uniquely applying machine-learning methods to a small, multimodal dataset from a study on student behavior in mathematics, we identified behavioral profiles, patterns in speech, and specific actions and gestures that are predictive of performance. These findings may be used to inform the design of embodied learning activities for measurement. We discuss the contribution of these findings to the field of embodied design, and the affordances and challenges of conducting collaborative research in the learning sciences. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

In this article, we describe a model of embodied cognition through analogical mapping that is supported through the participatory simulation and mathematical description of a link and pivot system. We look at the propensity for this model of embodied cognition to support student mechanistic reasoning. While these link and pivot systems provide students with immediate perceptual accessibility to their components, they do not provide perceptual accessibility to the way that forces are transmitted through them. In an afterschool STEM program, students engaged in a participatory simulation (the Rope Walk) of the link and pivot system that allowed them to simulate the parts and forces present. Then, students progressively re-described these physical experiences as a mathematical system; they then described the simulation and mathematical system as the physical link and pivot system. In this study, this model of embodied cognition was validated through a microgenetic analysis of student talk and gesture during the first two instructional sessions as well as during pre- and post-assessments. These data show that students were supported to construct analogical mappings between three analog conceptual domains: the participatory simulation (the Rope Walk), the physical system (link and pivot system), and the mathematical system (the mathematics of circles). In addition, students made gains on measures of mechanistic reasoning and explanation. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

The AR technology allows students to conduct hands-on laboratory experiments and interactively explore various science phenomena covering biology, chemistry, and physics concepts. In this study, seventy ninth-grade students carried out science laboratory experiments in pairs to learn thermodynamics. Our cluster analysis identified two groups of students, which differed significantly in navigation length and breadth. The two groups demonstrated unique navigation patterns that revealed students’ various ways of observing, describing, exploring, and evaluating science phenomena. These navigation patterns were associated with learning performance as measured by scores on lab reports. The results suggested the need for providing access to multiple representations and different types of interactions with these representations to support effective science learning as well as designing representations and connections between representations to cultivate scientific reasoning skills and nuanced understanding of scientific processes. © The Author(s) 2021.},

Building on four existing principles in child–computer interaction, namely Closeness, Embodied Learning, Design Process and Decoding, we explore how computational empowerment can be scaffolded in practice. This study was part of an interdisciplinary research project exploring emerging technologies in education (CEED). We involved 9 teachers and 26 students (14–15 y) in Denmark in teaching about machine learning and augmented reality. In the article we develop a framework for applying computational empowerment in formal educational contexts. Based on the study, we found that computational empowerment builds on distinct layers which are these four principles. Specifically, merging the principles Closeness and Embodied Learning can increase student engagement and motivation in the activities; in addition, Decoding and Design Process are key principles for promoting student awareness of the societal impacts of emerging technologies.

	abstract = {Theories of grounded and embodied cognition offer a range of accounts of how reasoning and body-based processes are related to each other. To advance theories of grounded and embodied cognition, we explore the cognitive relevance of particular body states to associated math concepts. We test competing models of action-cognition transduction to investigate the cognitive relevance of directed actions to students’ mathematical reasoning in the area of geometry. The hypotheses we test include (1) that cognitively relevant directed actions have a direct effect on performance (direct cognitive relevance hypothesis), (2) that cognitively relevant directed actions lead to more frequent production of gestures during explanations, which leads to improved performance (mediated cognitive relevance hypothesis), and (3) that performance effects of directed actions are influenced by the presence or absence of gesture production during mathematical explanations (moderated cognitive relevance hypothesis). We explore these hypotheses in an experiment where high school students (N = 85) evaluated the truth of geometry conjectures after performing cognitively relevant or cognitively irrelevant directed actions while playing a movement-based video game. Contrary to the direct and mediated cognitive relevance hypotheses, we found no overall differences in performance or gesture production between relevant and irrelevant conditions. Consistent with the moderated cognitive relevance hypothesis, cognitive relevance influenced mathematical performance, as measured by the accuracy of students’ intuitions, insights, and the validity of their proofs, provided that students produced certain kinds of gestures during mathematical explanations (i.e., with explanatory gestures as the moderator). Implications for theories of grounded and embodied cognition and the design of embodied forms of educational interventions are discussed. © 2022 Cognitive Science Society LLC.},

	abstract = {Background: To inform STEM education for benefiting emerging bilingual (EB) and English fluent (EF) students, the present study evaluated the order effects of integrating science and arts within a large-scale, ongoing effort investigating the efficacies of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)-aligned Science Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) methodologies to provide more equitable opportunities to students to learn science through Arts integration (STEAM). The experiment examines the curriculum integrating order of implementing combinations of STEM and STEAM approaches in fifth grade life and physical science instruction, comparing (STEM → STEAM) vs (STEAM → STEM). Results: T tests and a three-way between-groups analysis of covariance examined the impact of instructional order, language fluency, and teachers’ implementation fidelity. Findings indicate similar results in life and physical sciences, in which the STEAM first approach produced significantly higher science learning gains for both EF and EB students, revealing some higher learning gains for EF students, but with greater STEAM first order effect advantages for EB students overall. While EF students show higher learning gain scores in the high fidelity classrooms, the advantage of the STEAM first order is greater for EB students in all classroom fidelity levels and even within low to moderate implementation fidelity classrooms, as may commonly occur, such that the integration order of STEAM before STEM strategy is particularly advantageous to EB learners. Conclusions: The integration pattern of leading with STEAM and following with STEM offers an important opportunity to learn for EB students, and increases equity in opportunities to learn among EB and EF learners of science. Both EB and EF students benefit similarly and significantly in high fidelity implementation classrooms. However, the gains for EF students are not significant in low fidelity implementation classrooms, while in such low fidelity implementation classrooms, the EB students still benefited significantly despite the poor implementation. These results suggest that a strong compensating STEAM first order effect advantage is possibly involved in the implementation system for the EB population of learners. Teaching science through the arts with STEAM lessons is an effective approach that can be significantly improved through introducing STEM units with the STEAM first order effect advantage. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This study explored two different ways for K-12 school teachers to access educational makerspace through virtual fieldtrips. K-12 school teachers from rural areas of the Southeast USA were divided into two groups. The experimental group (n = 48) drove telepresence robots to take their fieldtrip, while the comparison group (n = 23) watched the same fieldtrip through a recorded video. Analyses of the quantitative and qualitative data, collected through surveys and written reflections, showed that the experimental group reported significantly higher scores in embodiment, social presence and engagement (ie, behaviour, emotion and cognition) than the comparison group, and that actual driving the robots for the virtual fieldtrips was highlighted as a favored experience. Educational significance and implications are discussed. Practitioner notes What is currently known about this topic With makerspaces gaining increasing attention in K-12 education, professional development (PD) opportunities are needed to help teachers understand makerspaces and related technologies. Teachers in rural areas are faced with the challenges of accessing makerspace resources and opportunities, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Little research has explored teacher makerspace PD in rural areas. Maker resource deficiency in rural areas and the COVID-19 pandemic call for an alternative approach to the makerspace PD, particularly for teachers in rural areas. What this paper adds Explored the use of telepresence robots for rural teachers to access an authentic makerspace through virtual fieldtrips. Examined the effects of virtual fieldtrip to access makerspaces on K-12 teachers' embodiment, social presence and engagement. Examined the aspects of the telepresence fieldtrip that were most valuable to K-12 teachers. Investigated the factors that contribute to teachers' engagement in a virtual fieldtrip. Implications for practitioners Telepresence robot was an effective tool that enabled teachers in rural areas to explore authentic makerspaces through a virtual trip over distance. To help teachers conceptualize the idea of makerspace, it is important to allow teachers to move in the physical makerspace and interact with the environment. To design an engaging fieldtrip that triggers active learning, more attention should be given to how to develop the emotional aspect of a fieldtrip experience. Embodiment plays an important role in virtual fieldtrips. When teachers have a higher level of embodiment, they are more likely to be emotionally and cognitively engaged in a fieldtrip experience. © 2022 British Educational Research Association.},

	abstract = {Strong spatial skills are foundational in predicting students' performance in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. Decades of research have considered the relationship between thinking spatially and how scientists reason and solve problems. However, few studies have examined the factors that influence improvement in students' spatial thinking during their school science curricula. The present study investigates the ThinkSpace curricula—two middle school astronomy units designed to support students' ability to apply the spatial skill of perspective-taking (PT) while learning to explain lunar phases (3 days) and the seasons (8 days). U.S. students in 6th and 8th grades (N = 877) across four districts participated in the study, completing assessments before and after the ThinkSpace curricula, along with an additional group of students in 6th and 7th grades (N = 172) who participated as a spatial control group. Data collection included multiple-choice content assessments, PT skill assessments, and interviews (from a sub-sample of 96 students), before and after instruction. After participating in ThinkSpace curricula, students demonstrated improved spatial thinking within the domain of astronomy, as measured by improved written content assessments, increased application of PT during conceptual interviews, and a general measurement of PT skill. Higher initial PT skill and higher gain in PT skill predicted greater improvement in students' astronomy understanding, even when accounting for their initial content knowledge. Although ThinkSpace students in all demographic groups improved PT skill post-instruction, 8th graders (who were in districts with lower SES), and females were predicted to have smaller gains in their PT skill than the 6th graders (who were in districts with higher SES) and male students. These findings suggest that middle school students' spatial thinking in science can be improved during their middle school science curricula, but questions remain concerning how to reduce spatial-learning gaps that are associated with gender and possibly SES. © 2022 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.},

	abstract = {The burden placed by human activities on Earth is ever-increasing. Global environmental changes have profoundly affected the Earth’s core systems and processes, thus, risking their stability. These core systems and processes are described in the planetary boundary framework. The drastic rate of environmental change over the last 200 years, which is also known as the Great Acceleration, has been depicted graphically by the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program. This study is aimed to (1) examine the conceptions of students and scientists regarding socioeconomic growth within planetary boundaries, and (2) develop instructional guidelines based on the comparison of their conceptions. Accordingly, relevant conceptions of 22 junior and 20 senior secondary school students were analyzed. Scientists’ conceptions were extracted by thoroughly analyzing nine publications, which were selected by systematic literature search. Student statements and scientific inferences were coded following established protocols. Our results indicated that junior and senior secondary school students considered global population growth to be the primary cause of global environmental changes. On the contrary, the scientists considered the quantity of natural resources consumed by rich countries in their economic pursuits as the most critical factor in environmental degradation. Based on our findings, we proposed instructional guidelines for planning lessons on changing current socioeconomic systems to enable humans to live within planetary boundaries. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Embodied cognition theory denotes that knowledge is incorporated into the body’s sensorimotor system, which facilitates learning and understanding abstract concepts. In this context, several interaction modalities have been introduced to design learning experiences that promote multisensory processing. This study examined the impacts of the type of embodied interaction modality on learning gains in a real classroom context. The researchers designed learning interfaces involving different interaction modalities including tablet application, tangible user interface, motion-based technology, and multimodal interaction. Thirty-six primary school students (aged 7 to 9) were assigned to four groups to learn the basics of the human body anatomy. The study adopted an immediate and a 20-day delayed post-test to measure students’ knowledge retention. Regardless of interaction modality type, participants showed significant immediate learning gains. However, participants in the multimodal embodiment conditions performed better on the delayed post-test. The findings suggested that multimodal embodied interaction, merging between body movements and tangible user interfaces, may lead to better knowledge retention. The process of performing body movements and physical interaction offered an alternative and a complementary encoding strategy for understanding and memorizing the learning concepts. © 2021, Beijing Normal University.},

One of the risks of online education is the lack of embodied interactions. We investigate what embodied interactive technologies might offer for teaching trigonometry when learning at a distance. In a multiple case study, we analyze the potential of embodied action-based design for fostering conceptual understanding of a sine graph. It appears that independent learning with tablet-based activities leads to acquiring new sensory-motor coordinations. Some students include these new embodied experiences into mathematical discourse and trigonometry problem solving themselves, while others still need some support from a teacher. However, distantly acquired embodied experiences can be easily recalled in a few days after learning and serve well as a substrate for further conceptualization and problem-solving. The results speak for a clear contribution that embodied design might provide for grounding conceptual understanding in distance learning. However, we expect embodied design to be particularly helpful in a blended learning format. © 2021 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

However, it remains unclear that whether hands-on experience aids understanding of geometry knowledge for middle school students. We also know little about the neural basis underlying the value of hands-on experience in math education. In this study, 40 right-handed Chinese students (20 boys and 20 girls) with different academic levels were selected from 126 seventh-grade students in the same school, who learnt “Axisymmetric of an Isosceles Triangle” in different learning style (hands-on operation vs. video observation). Half of them operated the concrete manipulatives while the other half watched the instructional videos. The learning-test paradigm and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) technique were used to compare the differences in geometry reasoning involved in solving well-structured problems and ill-structured problems. Behavioral results showed that hands-on experience promoted students’ performances of geometry problem-solving. Students with lower academic level were more dependent on hands-on experience than those with higher academic level. The fNIRS results showed that meaningful hands-on experience with concrete manipulatives related to learning contents increased reactivation of the somatosensory association cortex during subsequent reasoning, which helped to improve the problem-solving performance. Hands-on experience also reduced students’ cognitive load during the well-structured problem-solving process. These findings contribute to better understand the value of hands-on experience in geometry learning and the implications for future mathematics classroom practices.

We conducted a comparative case study of four grade seven and eight students working in a Scratch task (Code the Quilts) and a game (Transformations Quest) to construct understandings of geometric transformations. Our findings suggest: (1) students hybridized their personal experience of motion and mathematical knowledge of mapping to build geometric transformations understandings and (2) the co-action space in which students worked promoted distributed interactions between students, block-based environments, and tasks to support hybridizing. © 2023 Crown Copyright.},

Results indicate that children had positive perceptions about the activities. In addition, young children’s algorithmic thinking and debugging emerged most frequently.

This research aimed to (a) evaluate the potential of teaching and learning Dynamic Systems Theory (DST) and Statistical Physics (ST) general concepts through embodied experiences in elementary school and, based on it (b) enable a far transfer analogical reasoning within and between different academic subjects. Methods: Forty-eight elementary school students, aged 10.2 ± 0.82 y.o., followed an 8-week, 2-h/week intervention. The learning protocol contained a concreteness fading sequence of phases and consisted of four steps: (a) embodied experience, (b) reflective observation, (c) abstract conceptualization of DST/ST concepts, and (d) transfer of the DST/SP concepts to physical, sociological, biological and ecological phenomena. A validated questionnaire and an interview evaluated students’ knowledge and analogical reasoning. Results: The Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test showed a general positive effect of the intervention on the understanding of DSP/SP concepts and on the far transfer competencies of students (Z = −5.98; p {\textless} 0.0001). There was no association between the previous and newly acquired competencies (Spearman’s ρ = 0.112; p = 0.441). Discusion: The qualitative results showed that, in general, the suggested embodied learning protocol supports the acquisition of DST/SP general concepts and the far transfer competencies. However, students of this age are possibly highly sensitive to the balance of the focus between the embodied phases and the conceptualization/transfer phases of the learning protocol. The study points to the potential of learning the general DST/SP for elementary school students’ integrative and far transfer competencies. The DST/SP concept-based transdisciplinary embodied education may offer a truly integrative approach to STEAM teaching. Copyright © 2023 Almarcha, Vázquez, Hristovski and Balagué.},

By focusing on redesigning a board game as a pedagogical approach, rather than designing one from scratch, we intended to limit the vast creative design possibilities and engage learners more deeply with the discipline of mathematics. We conducted a design-based research project in a culturally and linguistically diverse Canadian school. Our video analysis identified embodied discourses wherein a student with limited English language proficiency came to be a designer of a board game, while meaningfully engaging in mathematics learning. Our findings demonstrate how the conversations between a newly arrived immigrant student and the teacher in the process of redesigning an existing board game helped the student fully participate in the classroom practice, maximizing the available cultural and linguistic resources. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

	abstract = {To reach for abstraction is a major but challenging goal in mathematics education: teachers struggle with finding ways how to foster abstraction in their classes. To shed light on this issue for the case of geometry education, we align theoretical perspectives on embodied learning and abstraction with practical perspectives from in-service teachers. We focus on the teaching and learning of realistic geometry, not only because this domain is apt for sensori-motor action investigations, but also because abstraction in realistic geometry is under-researched in relation to other domains of mathematics, and teachers’ knowledge of geometry and confidence in teaching it lag behind. The following research question will be addressed: how can a theoretical embodied perspective on abstraction in geometry education in the higher grades of primary school inform current teacher practices? To answer this question, we carried out a literature study and an interview study with in-service teachers (n = 6). As a result of the literature study, we consider embodied abstraction in geometry as a process of reflecting on, describing, explaining, and structuring of sensory-motor actions in the experienced world through developing and using mathematical artifacts. The results from the interview study show that teachers are potentially prepared for using aspects of embodied learning (e.g., manipulatives), but are not aware of the different aspects of enactment that may invite students’ abstraction. We conclude that theories on embodiment and abstraction do not suffice to foster students’ abstraction process in geometry. Instead, teachers’ knowledge of embodied abstraction in geometry and how to foster this grows with experience in enactment, and with the discovery that cognition emerges to serve action.

To explore the developmental process of children’s computational thinking in twenty-first century, an experimental study was proposed to study the children’s acquisition of computational thinking (CT) concepts and skills through compulsory lessons in schools starting in the fourth grade. A computational thinking framework along with six units of programming lessons were developed as a part of the research, aiming to develop primary (or elementary) school students’ computational problem-solving skills through a hybrid-based design of programming activities: combining unplugged (i.e., embodied cognitive activities without computing devices) and plugged (i.e., programming activities with computing devices) approach. Five primary schools participated in our main study, and a mixed method research was conducted with 400 fourth grade students (Male = 259; Female = 141) and 18 teachers involved in delivering our designed lessons. The findings in our study show that students achieved learning gains in basic computational thinking skills in solving programming problems under this hybrid-based learning approach. These findings can give insight for educators and researchers interested in incorporating computational thinking in primary education, which sets forth a research direction on the developmental aspects of computational thinking for children in the neo-Piagetian perspective. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Counting them, children explore, rearrange, and reinterpret the environment through the haptic channel. Vision generally complements physical actions, which makes using traditional manipulatives limited for children with visual impairments (VIs). Digitally augmenting manipulatives with feedback through alternative modalities might improve them. We specifically discuss conveying number representations to children with VIs using haptic and auditory channels within an environment encouraging exploration and supporting active touch counting strategies while promoting reflection. This paper presents LETSMath, a tangible system for training basic mathematical skills of children with VIs, developed through Design-Based Research with three iterations in which we involved 19 children with VIs and their educators. We discuss how the system may support training skills in the composition of numbers and the impact that the different system features have on slowing down the interaction pace to trigger reflection, on understanding, and on incorporation. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

The produced multimodal data is used to uncover cognitive, behavioural, and affective processes during the embodied learning activity. However, the use of eye-tracking data presenting visual attention to understand students’ behaviours and learning performance during engagement with tangible learning activity is rather unexplored. Therefore, this paper explores the integration of eye-gaze features to predict students’ learning performance during an embodied activity. We present an in-situ study where 110 primary school students (aged 8–9 years), solved a tangible learning activity for learning human body anatomy. During the experiment, students’ learning experience was monitored by collecting their eye-tracking data, learning profiles, academic performances, and time to complete the activity. We applied predictive modelling to identify the synergies between eye-gaze features and students’ learning performance. The obtained results suggest that combining eye-gaze tracking with learning traces and behaviour attributes may support an accurate prediction of students’ learning performance. This research sheds light on the opportunities offered in the intersection of eye-gaze tracking with learning traces, and its possible contribution to investigating students’ behaviour within an embodied learning context. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

However, there is little research on the ways in which bi/multilingual mathematics teachers can make use of diverse multilingual and multimodal resources to keep students engaged in learning abstract mathematical knowledge. This article aims to explore how an English-medium-instruction (EMI) mathematics teacher creates different hypothetical scenarios through embodied enactments to enhance students’ mathematical understanding and motivate students’ interest in learning mathematics. The data of this study is obtained from a focused classroom observation in a Hong Kong EMI secondary mathematics classroom. Multimodal conversation analysis is employed to analyse the classroom interaction data, and the analysis is triangulated with video-stimulated-recall interviews which are analysed with interpretative phenomenological analysis. This article aims to extend the notion of embodied enactment as a form of translanguaging to facilitate mathematical learning and develop students’ motivation in learning mathematics in the EMI setting. Particularly, this article argues that embodied enactment creates a translanguaging space for the EMI teacher to achieve mathematical teaching. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Understanding and effectively using visual representations is important to learning science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Various techniques to visualize information, such as two- and three-dimensional graphs, diagrams, and models, not only expand our capacity to work with different types of information but also actively recruit our visual–spatial thinking. Data physicalization is emerging as a beginner-friendly approach to construct information visualization. Mapping intangible data onto tangible artifacts that possess visual, spatial, and physical properties demands an interplay of spatial thinking and hands-on manipulation. Much existing literature has explored using formatted infographics to aid learning and spatial thinking development. However, there is limited insight into how children may leverage their spatial thinking to create information visualizations, particularly tangible ones. This case study documented the data physicalization activities organized in two design classrooms of an international school in Netherlands, with 37 children aged 11–12. Seven themes relevant to spatial thinking were identified from multimodal evidence gathered from the data physicalization artifacts, classroom videos and recordings of children’s making process, and semi-structured interviews with children. Our findings suggested that these children generated various ideas to create visual–spatial forms for data with the materials at hand, such as mapping quantities to tangible materials of different sizes, using spatial ordinal arrangement, and unitizing materials to set visual parameters. Meanwhile, they evaluated and adjusted the visual–spatial properties of these materials according to the numerical data they had, crafting feasibility, and others’ spatial perspectives. What was particularly interesting in our findings was children’s iteration on their visual–spatial understandings of the intangible numerical values and the tangible materials throughout the embodied making processes. Overall, this study illustrated the different types of spatial thinking children applied to create their data physicalizations and offered insights into how embodied experiences accompanying the open-ended visualization challenge allowed children to explore and construct spatial understandings.

	abstract = {While AI has become more prevalent in our society than ever, many young learners are found holding various naive, erroneous conceptions of AI due to the influence of their technology and media environments. To address this issue, this study seeks to propose a novel pedagogical solution to improve upper-elementary school students' scientific understanding of AI. Following a theory-informed design convention, we propose an embodied, analogical and disruptive (EAD) approach which is centred on a human–AI comparison through analogical teaching and embodied interaction. To evaluate the impact of this approach, a matched-group experimental study with pre- and posttest interviews was conducted among 77 Grade 6 elementary students in China. The statistical analysis showed that the experimental group, learning via the EAD approach, significantly outperformed their counterparts receiving direct instruction in terms of student growth in understanding. Qualitative analyses revealed the strengths of the EAD approach in supporting student engagement, abstract thinking and system thinking, and its limitations in cognitive overload and communication issues. Patterns of student learning were identified, including their mental schemas and strategies. The EAD approach, as an evidence-based, age-appropriate pedagogical solution, demonstrates the value of embodied cognition and human–AI analogy in AI education in elementary education. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Many young students hold naive, erroneous conceptions about AI. Pedagogical design has long been a critical challenge in teaching AI in K-12 schools. Human–AI analogies are often used to teach AI, but with obvious pitfalls to be fixed. What this paper adds An embodied, analogical and disruptive (EAD) approach is proposed to improve students’ understandings of AI. An experimental study shows statistically significant greater gains in students’ understanding with the EAD approach than with the conventional AI-only direct instruction approach. Qualitative analysis shows the strength of the EAD approach in supporting student engagement, abstract thinking and systems thinking, and its limitations in cognitive overload and communication issues. Implications for practice and/or policy The EAD approach offers a novel pedagogical solution to promote inclusive and quality AI education for young learners. The EAD approach highlights the pedagogical value of embodied cognition and human–AI analogy in AI education. The EAD approach can complement programming and other plugged activities in AI, and more broadly technology and engineering education. © 2023 The Authors.

However, little is known about the content knowledge (CK) and pedagogical knowledge (PK) possessed by early childhood teachers in this domain. To address this gap, we conducted a case study of an early childhood teacher in China who had experience developing and implementing an unplugged programming and CT curriculum. The triangulation of data sources was established to collect evidence from videotaped observations, interviews, and lesson plans. For the CK, analysis of these findings revealed that the teacher had a more robust understanding of CT concepts (e.g., sequences, conditionals, and loops) compared to CT practices (e.g., decomposition, debugging) and CT perspectives (e.g., perseverance, choices of conduct). In terms of PK, the teacher could apply the general pedagogical knowledge but was relatively weak in using content-specific pedagogical knowledge. As the first endeavor to investigate an early childhood teacher’s CK and PK in teaching programming and CT, this study provides significant implications for improving teachers’ professional knowledge and teaching effectiveness in this burgeoning area.

Taking a critical perspective to understand racialized experiences of using languages in disciplinary learning spaces, this article proposes the reconceptualization of embodiment as a language for racialized multilingual learners. This study was conducted in a Grade 1 classroom in a linguistically and racially diverse school in Canada. Through a series of professional development sessions, we worked with an experienced teacher to redesign the normalized and institutionalized pedagogy toward greater mobility of racialized multilingual learners’ bodies, which was intertwined with their intellectual liberation. Focusing on the spatiality of pedagogy, the previously restrictive areas in the school were transformed into a place that augments embodied expression of mathematical ideas and agentive participation of minoritized learners. The analysis focused on the embodied discourse that participating racialized multilingual students used to actively engage in mathematical discussion. Our findings show that the designed pedagogy, characterized by the spatial and temporal expansion of the learning environment, offered more spaces for uncertainty and spontaneity with the decreased control of the teacher as an explicator.

Studies have pointed out that in robotics courses, learners face challenges in learning abstract content, such as constructing a robot with a good structure and writing programs to drive a robot to complete specific learning tasks. The present study proposed the embodied learning-based computer programming approach and applied it to the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robotics course. To evaluate its effectiveness, a quasi-experiment was conducted in one public primary school to explore its effects on students’ learning achievement, learning motivation, learning attitudes, learning engagement, and cognitive load. The experimental group (40 students) adopted the embodied learning-based computer programming approach, while the control group (40 students) adopted the conventional computer programming approach. The results showed that the experimental group had significantly better learning achievement in robotics than the control group, and that there was no significant difference in the cognitive load of the two groups. In terms of learning motivation, although both groups showed improvement, the experimental group had higher intrinsic learning motivation. In addition, the experimental group outperformed the control group with regard to learning attitudes and learning engagement (including cognitive, behavioral, and emotional engagement). Accordingly, this study could contribute to future research for developing more effective robotics teaching approaches and computer programming activity design. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Background: In learning astronomy, students need to shift between 3D and 2D representations involving complex interactions between the body and material environment. Little attention has been paid to the iconic nature of this astronomical diagramming. Purpose: This research explored the value for students of diagramming to reveal the structural relationships of astronomical phenomena. The study aimed to 1) operationalise Charles Peirce’s pragmatist semiotics to analyse students’ bodily and material reasoning 2) identify the iconic nature of students’ diagramming through Stjernfelt’s activating of Peirce’s iconicity. Sample: Two students (a pair) from a class of 30 Year 7 students (12 years old) and their teacher (1) from a government secondary school in Melbourne, Australia. Design and Methods: A micro-ethnographic approach to the analysis of video/audio records and student artefacts was utilised in the context of three moments from a 1 hr lesson on astronomy. This data was analysed using Peirce’s sign types of icon, index and symbol to construct a triadic account of the bodily and material nature of students’ reasoning as diagramming. Results: The two students determined, by revealing structural relationships with their bodies as well as a mini-whiteboard and a torch and globe, that the Sun is higher in the sky in Summer than Winter due to the Earth’s rotational axis with a tilt (of 23.5 degrees) and its elliptical orbit around the Sun. Conclusion: For students to transduct between 3D and 2D astronomical representations, they need to coordinate space-based and Earth-based perspectives through bodily and material diagramming that makes apparent key structural relationships (i.e. iconicity). © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

These activities were implemented in a Hong Kong kindergarten with a class of six 5-year-olds (Mage = 62.83 months, SD = 2.91) over a 6-week period. Methods: The study gathered data from multiple sources, including classroom observations, teacher interviews, and documents/artefacts. Results and Conclusions: The results showed that children could learn about AI through interaction with intelligent agents in embodied learning contexts. The findings of this study have implications for the broader field of digital technology education, particularly in the context of early childhood education. © 2023 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Significant progress has been achieved in universal basic education in African countries since the late 1990s. This study provides empirical evidence on the within- and across-country variation in numeracy skills performance among children based on nationally representative data from eight African countries (DR Congo, The Gambia, Ghana, Lesotho, Sierra Leone, Togo, Tunisia, and Zimbabwe). We assess whether and to what extent children with disabilities lag in numeracy skills and how much it depends on their type of disabilities. More specifically, we explore whether disabled children benefit equally from better school system quality. The assessment is analysed as a natural experiment using the performance of non-disabled children as a benchmark and considering the different types of disabilities as random treatments. We first evaluate the variation in average numeracy skills in the eight African countries. They can roughly be divided into low- and high-numeracy countries. We apply Instrumental Variable (IV) methods to control the endogeneity of completed school years when assessing subjects’ school performance and heterogeneous disability effects. Children with vision and hearing disabilities are not especially challenged in numeracy skills performance. The low numeracy skills among physically and intellectually disabled children are mainly attributable to their limited school attendance. Children with multiple disabilities are constrained both by low school attendance and by poor numeracy skills return to schooling. The average differences in school performance across the high- versus low-numeracy skill country groups are larger than the within-group average differences for disabled versus non-disabled kids. This indicates that school enrolment and quality are crucial for children’s learning of numeracy skills, and that disabled children benefit equally from better school quality across these African countries.

This paper presents an analysis of the way in which children describe programming concepts and their use of spontaneous co-speech gestures. We conducted two interviews at two different times (one directly after a programming activity, and one approximately two weeks later) with 45 primary school students in Saudi Arabia (aged 6 to 7). We analysed their responses when asked to explain two programming concepts: program and iteration. Participants using metaphorical gestures drew upon two overarching embodied metaphors in their explanations, namely (i) computing constructs as physical objects (ii) computing processes as a motion along the path. Participants moved their hands along one of three body-based axes (longitudinal, transverse, and frontal) when referring to chronological sequences. These findings were broadly in keeping with those found in previous work on University computing students’ gestures. However, our study also showed that gestures used by child learners whose first language is a right-to-left language (i.e., Arabic) had directional differences compared to the gestures used by adult learners whose first language is a left-to-right language (e.g., English). This work is the first step towards understanding young children's embodied descriptions of programming concepts following introductory programming activities, and the potential role of gestures in supporting their learning. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

These studies of older students have focused mainly on students’ creative products rather than creative processes. The authors of the present study investigated four young elementary school students’ creative processes through eye-tracking (ET) and stimulated recall interview (SRI) techniques while they engaged in multiple representations (MRs) of mathematical problems. Our qualitative case study revealed what phases four elementary school students’ creative processes in MRs involve and how they achieve original ideas. The results revealed that neither Wallas’ (1926) creative process of mathematicians nor Schindler and Lilienthal’s (2020) creative process of a high school student could fully explain the creative processes of four young elementary school students in the present study. The findings from the present study emphasize that four young students’ creative processes are difficult to predict as it is non-linear compared to professional mathematicians’ creative process, but young students’ creative processes can be demystified through ET and SRI techniques. The present study also emphasizes the importance of external factors (e.g., teachers, peers, environment) for the four elementary school students to get different perspectives to achieve creative ideas in mathematics. © 2022, Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc.},

	abstract = {Metaphors in gesture and speech play a pivotal role in the way that programming concepts are presented in the classroom. However, little is known about the function of teachers’ metaphors in practice. This study aims to explore teachers’ use of metaphors in gesture and speech in a lecture on programming. Based on video observations of three upper secondary teachers, we employ Metaphor Identification Procedure (MIP) and Metaphor Identification for Gesture Guidelines (MIG-G) as methodological tools for identifying metaphoric speech and gestures related to programming concepts. The results of the study reveal that the gestures of the three teachers mainly function in two ways: (1) to add spatial properties to a programming concept and (2) to provide additional imagery for a programming concept. Consequently, the gestures identified in this study reduce the communicative burden of teachers’ speech. Furthermore, the study reveals that teachers’ gestures serve as means for making abstract concepts more tangible. For example, gestures concerning the abstract term “data” can generally be related to an object that could be received or moved. Hence, despite its metaphorical origin, data could be considered a graspable aspect of programming. Furthermore, spatial gestures enable the teachers to communicate programming processes in a tangible way, for example assigning programming processes a forward direction. Theoretical implications, potential implications for teaching and future research are discussed in the paper. © 2022, The Author(s).},

We focus on students’ responses in a specific task belonging to the Italian large-scale assessment analyzed through the Rasch model, and we deepen the task analysis thanks to interviews, which enlightened image schemas and metaphors underlying students’ reasoning. From the qualitative point of view, the Rasch model shows that students’ difficulties in dealing with percentages is a macrophenomenon that involves the higher levels of competences. From the qualitative point of view, the metaphoric approach outlines the image schemas that foster the correct conceptualization of percentage and those that hinder their correct learning and can be one of the possible causes of the emerging aforementioned macrophenomenon. © 2023 by authors; licensee EJSME by Bastas.},

	abstract = {Background: The relation between the human body movements and cognition has been a research hotspot in physical education and health promotion in recent years. This study applied the embodied cognition theory to examine the effects of the Movement Integrity with Intelligent Play (MIIP) program on preschoolers’ math performance. Objective: This study explores whether the Movement Integrity with Intelligent Play is connected with math performance, physical activity (PA) levels, and enjoyment of kindergarten students. Method: A quasi-experimental trial was delivered to evaluate the effects of the MIIP program that integrated bodily movements into math cognitive tasks related to pattern cognitive skills. A total of 54 (N = 54, 30 girls, Mage = 75.69 ± 3.36) children from two preschool classrooms served as participants and were assigned to one of the following two conditions: the integrated condition group (ICG, n = 28), and the conventional condition group (CCG, n = 26). During a 2-week intervention period, the ICG received a task-relevant PA (3×30 min/wk) in addition to their regular in-school math lessons (2×30 min/wk). Finally, math performance, PA levels, and enjoyment were assessed. Results: Following the intervention, significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) in math performance, PA levels, and enjoyment were found in the ICG. The results demonstrated that preschool children in ICG outperformed children in the CCG. Children in the CCG showed no significant differences in math performance and PA levels. In addition, children in the ICG scored higher scores (M = 9.25 ± 2.71) on perceived enjoyment of the instructional method than children in the CCG (M = 7.07 ± 3.91). Conclusions: The integrated intervention has beneficial effects not only on math performance, PA levels but also on enjoyment. Transforming the focus of instruction to an integrated PA enhanced both math performance, PA levels, and increased enjoyment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

That is, they take the perspective of the protagonist who is made to feel included or excluded to see how it affects his or her body thermally. However, there are no studies in which the participants morally evaluate other protagonists who are the ones who feel the inclusion or exclusion and the temperature, projecting these feelings onto them. This paper analyzes the relationship between terms related to temperature (cold or heat) and the moral judgements made toward a person who helps and another who does not help. All this occurs in a situation in which the person making the judgement is not involved in the first person and has to put themself in the place of the other. In addition, the possible difference in these judgements is examined by comparing children in the fourth grade of primary school with those in the sixth grade. The results indicate that older children give less extreme responses, but these are more influenced by temperature when it comes to morally judging a lack of help. When the behavior is helpful, they judge it morally the same regardless of temperature. In addition, interaction between the two variables appeared. These results have implications in promoting helping in the classroom in order to promote inclusion and represent a useful and accessible resource for such promotion. © 2023 by the authors.},

The current study aims at contributing to this last perspective. Based on data from a 3rd grade plurilingual classroom in an Italian school, it observes the ‘catchments’ (McNeill, 2000) in teacher’s gesticulation during a cycle of lessons on “The origin of life”. The analysis identifies conceptual components based on the time is space metaphor associated with gestures, and observes their alignment with lexical items – either technical or common words (evolution, ages, ancestors, archaic; change, back, old) – in speech. The gesture-word association supports both the conceptualization of the notions and the acquisition of the related lexicon: gestures connect recurring concepts to their different verbalisations, ensuring a conceptually coherent representation over the lesson; they establish synonimic relations between technical and common words; and they can also work as memory triggers towards and between concepts and lexical units. © 2022 John Benjamins.},

Three groups of in-service teachers collaboratively explored six geometric conjectures with various virtual objects (geometric shapes) under the guidance of a facilitator. Although all the teachers were in different physical locations, they logged into a single virtual classroom with their respective groups and were able to see and manipulate the same geometric shapes as well as see their collaborators’ avatars and actions on the shapes in real time in the shared virtual space. This paper introduces a novel multimodal data analysis method for analyzing participants’ interactive patterns in collaborative forms of actions, gestures, movements, and speech. Results show that collaborative speech has a strong simultaneous relationship with actions on virtual objects and virtual hand gestures. They also showed that body movements and positions, which often focus on virtual objects and shifts in these movements away from or around the object, often signal key interactional collaborative events. In addition, this paper presents five emergent multimodality interaction themes showing participants’ collaborative patterns in different problem-solving stages and their different strategies in collaborative problem-solving. The results show that virtual objects can be effective media for collaborative knowledge building in shared VR environments, and that structured activity design and moderate realism may benefit shared VR learning environments in terms of equity, adaptability, and cost-effectiveness. We show how multimodal data analysis can be multi-dimensional, visualized, and conducted at both micro and macro levels. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Students were asked to programmatically choreograph dance performances for virtual characters within an educational desktop application we built earlier called Virtual Environment Interactions (VEnvI). As part of a middle school science class, 90 students from the 6th and 7th grades participated in our study. All students first visually programmed dance choreography for a virtual character they created in VEnvI on a laptop. Then, they viewed and interacted with the resulting dance performance in a between-subjects design in one of the three conditions. We compared and contrasted the benefits of embodied immersive virtual reality (EVR) viewing utilizing a head-mounted display with a body-scaled and gender-matched self-avatar, immersive virtual reality only (IVR) viewing, and desktop VR (NVR) viewing with VEnvI on pedagogical outcomes, programming performance, presence, and attitudes towards STEM and computational thinking. Results from a cognition questionnaire showed that, in the learning dimensions of Knowledge and Understanding (Bloom's taxonomy) as well as Multistructural (SOLO taxonomy), participants in EVR and IVR scored significantly higher than NVR. Also, participants in EVR scored significantly higher than IVR. We also discovered similar results in objective programming performance and presence scores in VEnvI. Furthermore, students' attitudes towards computer science, programming confidence, and impressions significantly improved to be the highest in EVR and then IVR as compared to NVR condition. Our work suggests that educators and developers of educational VR simulations, who want to enhance knowledge and understanding as well as simultaneous acquisition of multiple abstract concepts, can do so by employing immersion and self-avatars in VR learning experiences.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.},

These imaginings are important in science. But does imagination matter in science education? What is the role of imagination in science education in the early years of school? To answer this question, we undertook a cultural-historical study of 18 children (5.6–7.4yers mean 6.4) and 4 teachers who participated in an educational experiment of a Conceptual PlayWorld over 11 weeks. A total of 34.2 h of digital video data were recorded. The results show how imagination was brought to bear on the scientific problem of the relations between the earth, moon, and Sun. The complex science being imagined by children and teachers brought forward imaginary moments and situations as embodied actions, socially engineered affective imagining, common play problems for motivated conditions for science learning, and the need for creating tangible pivots. These conditions developed different expression of imagination: affective imagining, embodied imagining, amplified imagining, and collective imagining. We argue that complexity in science under the conditions of a Conceptual PlayWorld develops different forms of imagining, thereby contributing to a more nuanced understanding of imagination in science education. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Science learning requires students to build new mental models of imperceptible mechanisms (photosynthesis, circadian rhythms, atmospheric pressure, etc.). Since mechanisms are structurally complex and dynamic, building such mental models requires mentally simulating novel structures, their state changes, and higher-order transformations (transpiration, oscillation, liquid levels, etc.). These mental simulations also need to be intertwined with a series of external representations (ERs), including formal terms (stomata, guard cells, mass points, damping, etc.), schematic structures (figures, graphs, etc.), and mathematical notations (equations, vectors, etc.). Students’ later encounters with these ERs activate the dynamic mental model of the mechanism. To help learners build such many-layered and dynamic mental models of mechanisms, teachers narrate, and act out, the structures, state changes, transformations, and related ERs. These cohere together to constitute (bring into being) the mechanism models. Based on classroom teaching data, we present a theoretical account of the cognitive mechanisms involved in this complex teaching-to-build process, extending the enactive simulation theory of language and distributed cognition theory. Since teaching narratives seek to approximate scientific mechanisms presented in textbooks, we extend this account to academic language, to understand how textbook descriptions embed mechanisms. We close with some theoretical and pedagogical implications of these two accounts. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Primary school students have trouble understanding concepts related to fractions. On the other hand, technology constantly provides interesting tools that stimulate students' interest and foster learning. Among these, tangible user interfaces allow users to interact with digital applications through the manipulation of everyday objects. Given that conventional tangible materials are already used in the teaching of fractions, the study at hand presents the results of a project in which their impact on learning was compared to that of materials digitally enhanced with the use of tangible user interfaces. The results indicated that the learning outcomes were better for the group of students who used the latter. Moreover, students' enjoyment was greater. However, there were no differences in terms of motivation, ease-of-use, and subjective learning effectiveness. The results can be attributed to both the characteristics of tangible user interfaces and the teaching framework that was followed. Nevertheless, the educational potential of tangible user interfaces has to be further explored. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Several lines of research have demonstrated spatial-numerical associations in both adults and children, which are thought to be based on a spatial representation of numerical information in the form of a mental number line. The acquisition of increasingly precise mental number line representations is assumed to support arithmetic learning in children. It is further suggested that sensorimotor experiences shape the development of number concepts and arithmetic learning, and that mental arithmetic can be characterized as “motion along a path” and might constitute shifts in attention along the mental number line. The present study investigated whether movements in physical space influence mental arithmetic in primary school children, and whether the expected effect depends on concurrency of body movements and mental arithmetic. After turning their body towards the left or right, 48 children aged 8 to 10 years solved simple subtraction and addition problems. Meanwhile, they either walked or stood still and looked towards the respective direction. We report a congruency effect between body orientation and operation type, i.e., higher performance for the combinations leftward orientation and subtraction and rightward orientation and addition. We found no significant difference between walking and looking conditions. The present results suggest that mental arithmetic in children is influenced by preceding sensorimotor cues and not necessarily by concurrent body movements. © 2023 The Authors},

The data come from a larger participatory design-based research project that incorporated play, environmental education, and embodiment in a STEAM curriculum.

Both the SBL and the MBL used computers to collect, graph, and analyze data. A major difference was that the MBL allowed the students to manipulate physical materials, whereas in the SBL activity they manipulated virtual materials. In this quasi-experimental design, two 11th-grade classes (N = 68) at an urban public high school in Taipei were assigned to the SBL and MBL settings. The participants conducted the Boyle's law experiment without having done any relevant prior experiment. Their science concepts, performance of inquiry tasks, and attitudes toward the SBL/MBL were examined by pre- and postconceptual tests, an inquiry-based lab manual, and postlaboratory interviews. The results showed that both groups performed equally well and had remarkable gains in their pre- to posttest learning achievement. Nevertheless, physical manipulation may have contributed to inquiry practices such as creating practical ideas for conducting and improving the experiment and interpreting the data and may have increased the enjoyment of the laboratory. This study concludes that virtual manipulation is as effective as physical manipulation in learning physics concepts, but that the former gives learners some naïve expectations and induces certain learning strategies that seem to lead to mindless planning and conducting of experiments and hinders them from generating ideas to improve experiments. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {The analysis of students' conceptions is a crucial element in modern science education research. Based on a large number of studies, we know that learning environments should build upon students' existing knowledge to initiate conceptual change towards an adequate scientific understanding. This also holds true when it comes to moral reasoning. In this case, the implementation of educational standards, such as decision-making competence, strongly relies on students' conceptions about ethical issues. In this study the Conceptual Metaphor Theory is used empirically in order to analyse students' language in regard to conceptual metaphors. To date, little educational research exists on the effects of moral metaphors in science education. For this reason, we conducted a two-part qualitative interview study (n = 9 + 6 and 6) in order to identify German high-school students' moral conceptions about animal ethics. The conceptions were identified and analysed by means of qualitative content analysis. A key finding can be seen in the underlying embodied conceptions and image schemas that are in particular linked to human well-being. Apparently, students use these metaphorical thinking patterns and are therefore capable of conceiving abstract conceptions about animal ethics. As a consequence, we propose an alternative approach in order to foster decision-making competence.},

The practices are explored in terms of their role in making visible the interconnectedness of humans, place and the more-than-human, drawing on posthuman educational theories and practice, in particular common worlds approaches, as well as place pedagogies. The project explores the practices of sit spot, solo wander, journalling, gathering, story-sharing and nature names with a group of children participating in an outdoor homeschool programme. Children's representations of their experiences in place through story, writing, drawing and the collection of items from nature are analysed to create narrative summaries, which are reflected on and presented with some of the children's journal entries. The study finds that when integrated together, the nature connection practices: foster embodied and generative place encounters; enable relationships with place and the more-than-human to emerge; cultivate learning with place and (re)story place relations. The paper recommends the use of these nature connection practices in programmes that focus on or integrate outdoor learning in order to generate new understandings about place that recognise the entanglement of humans, place and the more-than-human world.},

The problem statement reads that it is not clear how high school learners' computational thinking (CT) may be enhanced or improved at a cognitive level of formal operations. The research question posed is, 'How can CT be enhanced, among high school learners, using a PL aligned to Action-Process-Object-Schema (APOS) theory?'

The ontological underpinning of the study is subjective and the epistemological stance accepts opinions of learners through written, spoken and visual attributed meanings. The axiology of the researcher is that of a practising educator in programming, a teaching and learning expert and a certified Java-Alice-Greenfoot instructor through Oracle. The research strategy was based on educational design research as a validation study through interventions. Findings show that CT at a cognitive level of formal operations can be enhanced among learners through Greenfoot PL with APOS theory as lens.

We approach this challenge from an embodied cognition perspective, which suggests learning can be facilitated by engaging students in physical activities that are aligned with target concepts. This article describes two experiments where participants learned about exponential scales applied to measuring earthquakes (Richter scale) and the strength of acids/bases (pH scale). Whether participants engaged with an embodied simulation or used traditional instructional media for none, one, or both of these topics was manipulated across the two experiments. Experiment 1 recruited high school-aged participants and Experiment 2 recruited non-STEM undergraduate majors. Results from the experiments showed that using the embodied simulation led to greater declarative knowledge gains for the earthquake topic but not for acids/bases. Learning gains for the crosscutting concept (exponential growth) were higher for the embodied simulation participants on both topics. Especially notable was the finding that learning the crosscutting concept from an embodied simulation in one domain transferred to a second domain where the same concept was relevant. We discuss implications for applications of embodied cognition to the design of learning environments and to interventions that support learning transfer.
Educational Impact and Implications Statement This research lends support to the notion that students' natural movements (e.g., hand or full-body gestures) can be leveraged to facilitate both the learning of core STEM concepts and the transfer of those ideas to new topics. The two experiments described in this article provide empirical support for embodied learning, as well as design guidance for those interested in using immersive learning technologies such as mixed reality to create impactful educational activities.},

This qualitative case study is informed by the embodied cognition theory and social constructivism. Two purposively selected Grade 11 teachers were observed and video recorded while teaching trigonometry for a week in a multilingual policy environment. They were each interviewed for an hour. Results shows that iconic and deictic gestures were frequently used to link the teacher's verbal language and the diagrams on the chalkboard or what was previously learnt, to ground cognition into the physical teaching and learning environment. Metaphoric gestures were less used while beat gestures were not used. Results also show that there exists an intricate semiotic and symbiotic relationship between gestures (bodily actions), and spoken language (in two or more languages in the same environment). In this paper, I conclude that in multilingual classes all forms of teacher gestures that indicate and refers to objects and locations in reality may help improve learning. Gestures and verbal languages complement each other, and should be used as resources for mediating and scaffolding teaching and learning.},

This novel digital technology provides embodied and relational experiences of multiplication through two different dynamic multiplicative models. In interviews, these teachers shared their personal experiences learning about this relatively new digital application themselves, the obstacles they encountered and their experiences integrating TT into their instructional repertoires as a tool for student learning. My aim was to identify specific episodes in which transitions occurred during the implementation of technology-enhanced mathematics lessons and to highlight how instrumental distance influenced the teachers' professional instrumental genesis. These episodes focus on (1) the internal shifts in thinking that the teachers experience personally and professionally while undergoing double instrumental genesis; (2) transitions across the two different microworlds that comprise TT, and the different multiplicative models portrayed by each of them; and (3) transitioning beyond the dynamic multiplicative models portrayed by TT towards mathematical activities with a static medium. My analysis indicates that these transitions are multi-faceted and complex, that the personal and professional instrumental geneses that teachers undergo may be closely intertwined and that, when speaking of TT, they clearly differentiate between ways of teaching with it and how students may learn using this technology.},

To do so, we first review and bring together the theoretical perspectives of social semiotics and embodied cognition, therein developing a new methodological approach for analyzing student interactions during the learning of physics (particularly for those interactions involving students' bodies). Through the use of our new approach, we are able to show how students combine a diverse range of meaning-making resources into complex, enacted analogies, thus forming explanatory models that are grounded in embodied intuition. We reflect on how meaning-making resources--even when not physically persistent--can act as coordinating hubs for other resources as well as how we might further nuance the academic conversation around the role of the body in physics learning.},

The study provides a conceptual analysis of feedback and how the use of these models is related in the context of formative assessment for Linear Algebra problems. Particularly, the performance of a popular model known as ChatGPT in mathematical problems fails on reasoning, proofs, model construction, among others. Formative assessment is a process used by teachers and students during instruction that provides feedback to adjust ongoing teaching and learning to improve student’s achievement of intended instructional outcomes. The study analyzed and evaluated feedback provided to engineering students in their solutions, from both, instructors and ChatGPT, against fine-grained criteria of a formative feedback model that includes affective aspects. Considering preliminary outputs, and to improve performance of feedback from both agents’ instructors and ChatGPT, we developed a framework for formative assessment in mathematical problemsolving using a Large Language Model (LLM). We designed a framework to generate prompts, supported by common Linear Algebra mistakes within the context of concept development and problem-solving strategies. In this framework, the instructor acts as an agent to verify tasks in a math problem assigned to students, establishing a virtuous cycle of learning of queries supported by ChatGPT. Results revealed potentialities and challenges on how to improve feedback on graduate-level math problems, by which both educators and students adapt teaching and learning strategies.},

	abstract = {Physics education researchers are interested in using the tools of machine learning and natural language processing to make quantitative claims from natural language and text data, such as open-ended responses to survey questions. The aspiration is that this form of machine coding may be more efficient and consistent than human coding, allowing much larger and broader datasets to be analyzed than is practical with human coders. Existing work that uses these tools, however, does not investigate norms that allow for trustworthy quantitative claims without full reliance on cross-checking with human coding, which defeats the purpose of using these automated tools. Here we propose a four-part method for making such claims with supervised natural language processing: evaluating a trained model, calculating statistical uncertainty, calculating systematic uncertainty from the trained algorithm, and calculating systematic uncertainty from novel data sources. We provide evidence for this method using data from two distinct short response survey questions with two distinct coding schemes. We also provide a real-world example of using these practices to machine code a dataset unseen by human coders. We offer recommendations to guide physics education researchers who may use machine-coding methods in the future.},

	abstract = {A concern commonly raised in literature and in media relates to the declining proportions of students who enter and remain in the ‘science pipeline’, and whether many countries, including Australia and New Zealand, have enough budding scientists to fill research and industry positions in the coming years. In addition, there is concern that insufficient numbers of students continue in science to ensure an informed, scientifically literate citizenry. The aim of the research presented in this paper was to survey current Australian and New Zealand scientists to explore their reasons for choosing to study science. An online survey was conducted via a link to SurveyGizmo. The data presented are from 726 respondents who answered 22 forced-choice items and an open-ended question about the reasons they chose to study science. The quantitative data were analysed using t tests and analyses of variance followed by Duncan’s multiple range tests, and the qualitative data were analysed thematically. The quantitative data showed that the main reasons scientists reported choosing to study science were because they were interested in science and because they were good at science. Secondary school science classes and one particular science teacher also were found to be important factors. Of much less importance were the prestige of science and financial considerations. The qualitative data expanded on these findings and showed that passion for science and/or curiosity about the world were important factors and also highlighted the importance of recreational pursuits, such as camping when a child. In the words of one respondent, ‘People don’t go into science for the money and glory. It’s passion for knowledge and science that always attracted me to the field’.},

More specifically, we argue the point that such shifts between communicative approaches are an inevitable part of teaching whose purpose is to support meaningful learning of scientific knowledge. We suggest that a necessary tension therefore exists between authoritative and dialogic approaches as dialogic exchanges are followed by authoritative interventions (to develop the canonical scientific view), and the authoritative introduction of new ideas is followed by the opportunity for dialogic application and exploration of those ideas. In these ways, one communicative approach follows from the other, authoritativeness acting as a seed for dialogicity and vice versa. We discuss how this analysis, in terms of shifts in communicative approach, offers a new and complementary perspective on supporting “productive disciplinary engagement” (Engle \& Conant, 2002, Cognition and Instruction, 20, 399–484) in the classroom. Finally we consider some methodological issues arising from this study. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed 90:605–631, 2006},

Our interest in such events arises from their potential to stimulate active intellectual engagement in classrooms, which can impact upon the subsequent development of the classroom discourse. In investigating this issue we shall address the following research question: How do student questions impact upon the teaching explanatory structure and modify the form of the ongoing classroom discourse, in selected science lessons? From data collected in a Brazilian secondary school we have selected three classroom episodes, with large differences in both the context in which the student's question emerges and in the communicative approach developed in response to it. The analysis, based on the framework proposed by Mortimer and Scott [Mortimer and Scott (2003). Meaning making in secondary science classrooms. Maidenhead: Open University Press], shows that questions made by students are important in providing feedback from students to the teacher, enabling adjustments to the teaching explanatory structure. These adjustments sometimes occur smoothly, at other times with major changes to the features of the classroom discourse, and elsewhere with misunderstanding and disagreement. The data also suggest the need to consider students' intentions and their active participation in the negotiation of both the content and structure of classroom discourse. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Over the last 50 years, policy makers and STEM educators have argued for Scientific Literacy (SL). SL is a typical boundary object that everyone can agree on, but that is filled with different meanings by different stakeholders. Roberts (as published in Abell SK, Lederman NG (eds), Handbook of research on science education. Lawrence Erlbaum, Mahwah, pp. 729–780, 2007) has identified two main orientations of SL: Vision I starts from and focuses on scientific content and scientific processes to learn about corresponding applications later, while Vision II focuses on contextualizing scientific knowledge for giving its use in life and society meaning. The tension between Vision I and II can also be related to the tension between “pipeline science – preparing future scientists” and “science for all”. Recently, a more advanced vision of SL was suggested. It is called Vision III and emphasizes philosophical values, politicization and critical global citizenship education. Such an orientation can be well justified by the Central/Northern European educational and cultural tradition called Bildung. In its most contemporary understanding, it is agency-oriented. Bildung-oriented science education aims at making the student capable of a self-determined life in his/her socio-cultural environment, participation in a democratic society, and of empathy and solidarity with others. This concept is also closely connected to more recent educational paradigms that were defined also beyond Europe, e.g. the ideas of Education for Sustainability (EfS) and transformative learning. Both concepts aim on skills development for critical-democratic participation and for shaping our society and culture in a sustainable way. The different visions of SL have consequences for the content and culture of teaching and learning of science and technology. Accepting Vision III requires awareness that our view of selecting and teaching certain content is dependent on our culture, for example our norms, values and worldviews, and on the society we are living in. Learning (cognition) must be complemented with not only meta-learning (metacognition), but also transformative learning, where things are considered from multifaceted (e.g., cultural) perspectives. The discussion in this chapter focuses on educational implications of Vision III of SL and its connection to critical-reflexive Bildung, EfS and transformative learning.},

Utilizing interview data with professionals across STEM, we sought to understand the role failure played in the persistence of individuals who enter and pursue paths toward STEM-related careers. Findings highlighted how participants’ experiences with failure (1) shaped their outlooks or views of failure, (2) shaped their trajectories within STEM, and (3) provided them with additional skills or qualities. A few differences based on participants’ sex, field, and highest degree also manifested in our analysis.

To gain insight into students’ intentions to study non-compulsory physics, a longitudinal sample (covering 2258 students across 88 secondary schools in England) was surveyed in year 8 (age 12/13) and again in year 10 (age 14/15). Predictive modelling highlighted that perceived advice, perceived utility of physics, interest in physics, self-concept beliefs (students’ subjective beliefs of their current abilities and performance) and home support specifically orientated to physics were key predictors of students’ intentions. Latent-transition analysis via Markov models revealed clusters of students, given these factors at years 8 and 10. Students’ intentions varied across the clusters, and at year 10 even varied when accounting for the students’ underlying attitudes and beliefs, highlighting that considering clusters offered additional explanatory power and insight. Regardless of whether three-cluster, four-cluster, or five-cluster models were considered, the majority of students remained in the same cluster over time; for those who transitioned clusters, more students changed clusters reflecting an increase in attitudes than changed clusters reflecting a decrease. Students in the cluster with the most positive attitudes were most likely to remain within that cluster, while students in clusters with less positive attitudes were more likely to change clusters. Overall, the cluster profiles highlighted that students’ attitudes and beliefs may be more closely related than previously assumed, but that changes in their attitudes and beliefs were indeed possible.},

The teaching module is developed with a combination of the following parts of the didatic litterature: Inquiry Based Science Education (IBSE), Scenario Didactics and digital games as an educational tool. Using a nuclear power plant simulator embedded in a Twine-story, three groups of students were monitored during the teaching module. Three levels of network analysis ranging from a classroom perspective of the learning situation to the student interaction with the simulation exercise was carried out. The network analysis shows signs of development and training of 21st century skills as well as classic scientific skills such as formation of hypotheses. Along with semi-structered interviews of the participating students and their teacher, this study finds, that the intention of creating a narrative interactive and inquiry based teaching module, which stimulates development of necessary science skills using a digital simulation model, can be realized.},

	abstract = {In recent years cross-cutting skills have been emphasized as important in school curricula. One approach in teaching such skills is to introduce interdisciplinary teaching methods in the school programs. In 2004 a compulsory integrated science course was introduced in the most popular Danish upper secondary school programs (Stx). This course was called the Basic Science Course (BSC). One of the objectives for the BSC was to increase the collaboration between the science disciplines by requiring the different science disciplines to work together in an interdisciplinary fashion.
This thesis explores the interdisciplinarity of the BSC in three different aspects of the curricula; the intended curriculum was studied through ofﬁcial curriculum documents, the implemented curriculum by classroom observations and interviews with teachers and the real-ized curriculum through observations of the BSC exam situation.
For all three curricula, network analysis in various forms was used for a visual and quantitative analysis of the qualitative data. New variants of both linguistic and action networks were developed in order to investigate the interdisciplinarity of the BSC. In addition, the networks were expanded to also investigate the focus on the learning aims in the three curricula.
Although interdisciplinarity was a requirement in the curriculum documents, the network analysis showed no overwhelming focus on interdisciplinarity in the intended curriculum. In the implemented curriculum, the dominating trend was a pluridisciplinary degree of interdisciplinarity where the disciplines work in parallel rather than as a cooperation on a common topic. The study of the realized cur-riculum indicated that the BSC exams may be of both pluridisciplinary and (true) interdisciplinary character. However, as this part was a proof of concept study of only two exam situations, more data needs to be analyzed in order to demonstrate a clear trend.
In this study, the various forms of network analysis showed to be an advantageous method when used to describe and analyze the in-terdisciplinarity and learning aims of the intended, the implemented and realized curriculum of the BSC program. These various forms of network analysis provide a new way to investigate curriculum alignment.},

We argue that encoding and portraying observations of student and teacher actions in networks, may expand the use of observation protocols to capture the dynamics of teaching [7].The purpose of this poster is twofold. First, we illustrate how we encode video observations to network maps via an expanded version of the Classroom Obser- vation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM (COPUS) [1]. Second, we show an example network and a network map, which illustrate how observation networks may be used to analyse a lesson. Our example comes from a Danish project which developed and investigated high school physics teaching. The example network and network map of this study stems from video observations of one of the lessons from the project.},

	abstract = {Concept maps, which are network-like visualisations of the inter-linkages between concepts, are used in teaching and learning as representations of students’ understanding of conceptual knowledge and its relational structure. In science education, research on the uses of concept maps has focused much attention on finding methods to identify key concepts that are of the most importance either in supporting or being supported by other concepts in the network. Here we propose a method based on network analysis to examine students’ representations of the relational structure of physics concepts in the form of concept maps. We suggest how the key concepts and their epistemic support can be identified through focusing on the pathways along which the information is passed from one node to another. Towards this end, concept maps are analysed as directed and weighted networks, where nodes are concepts and links represent different types of connections between concepts, and where each link is assumed to provide epistemic support to the node it is connected to. The notion of key concept can then be operationalised through the directed flow of information from one node to another in terms of communicability between the nodes, separately for out-going and in-coming weighted links. Here we analyse a collated concept network based on a sample of 12 original concept maps constructed by university students. We show that communicability is a simple and reliable way to identify the key concepts and examine their epistemic justification within the collated network. The communicabilities of the key nodes in the collated network are compared with communicabilities averaged over the set of 12 individual concept maps. The comparison shows the collated network contains an extensive set of key concepts with good epistemic support. Every individual networks contain a sub-set of these key concepts but with a limited overlap of the sub-sets with other individual networks. The epistemically well substantiated knowledge is thus sparsely distributed over the 12 individual networks.},

Through the use of our new approach, we are able to show how students combine a diverse range of meaning-making resources into complex, enacted analogies, thus forming explanatory models that are grounded in embodied intuition. We reflect on how meaning-making resources—even when not physically persistent—can act as coordinating hubs for other resources as well as how we might further nuance the academic conversation around the role of the body in physics learning.},

We applied thematic analysis to examine students’ use of geometric and contextual ideas while solving a geometry problem that required them to determine the optimal location for a new grocery store on a map of their local community. Students established semantic patterns to connect the problem context to geometry. Groups differed in how they used geometry in their discussion of the solution, in particular with how students used distance to describe the location of a new grocery store. Overall, students’ knowledge of the problem context served as a resource for them to establish geometric meanings. Thematic analysis, which describes the connections in students’ talk between out-of-school and discipline-specific knowledge, highlights ways in which instruction can build upon students’ prior experiences for the purpose of learning in school.},

	abstract = {Introductory mechanics is an obligatory course for many disciplines outside of physics and the failure rate is often high. Even the students who pass the course often fail to achieve the main learning goal: The conceptual knowledge required for modeling situations with physics principles. In many cases, this is due to inefficient learning strategies. However, little work has been done on the integration of learning strategies into physics courses. Here we present a study where we integrated three established learning strategies into the teaching of an introductory mechanics course: elaborative encoding, retrieval practice, and self-explanation. We also developed three scaffolding tools to facilitate the integration of the strategies: elaborative encoding questions, a hierarchical principle structure, and a problem-solution structure with emphasis on physics modeling. The overarching aim of this study is to use students’ experience-based reflections to find ways to improve the integration of the learning strategies. To fulfill this aim, we seek answers to the following three interrelated research questions: (i) What are the students’ experiences and associated reflections with the learning strategies and tools? (ii) How do the students’ experiences and reflections align with established theory on the learning strategies? (iii) What main barriers to effective implementation of the learning strategies may be hypothesized? To answer these questions, we did semi-structured research interviews with 12 students. Through the thematic analysis, we found that retrieval practice was used extensively while self-explanation and elaborative encoding was partly or wholly ignored. The analysis, together with theoretical considerations, indicates that successful implementation of elaborative encoding is critical for maximizing the benefits from retrieval practice in physics. We also present some promising findings on two of the tools: (i) Students’ extensive use of the hierarchical principle structure and (ii) that some students started practicing physics modeling after exposure to the solution structure. Finally, we offer suggestions for how to overcome the barriers to effective implementation of each of the learning strategies.},

	abstract = {Social semiotic discussions about the role played by representations in effective teaching and learning in areas such as physics have led to theoretical proposals that have a strong common thread: in order to acquire an appropriate understanding of a particular object of learning, access to the disciplinary relevance aspects in the representations used calls for the attainment of representational competence across a particular critical constellation of systematically used semiotic resources (which are referred to as modes, see more on this later). However, an affirming empirical investigation into the relationship between a particular object of learning and different representational formulations, particularly with large numbers of students, is missing in the literature, especially in the context of university-level physics education. To start to address, this research shortfall the positioning for this article is that such studies need to embrace the complexities of student thinking and application of knowledge. To achieve this, both factor and network analyses were used. Even though both approaches are grounded in different frameworks, for the task at hand, both approaches are useful for analyzing clustering dynamics within the responses of a large number of participants. Both also facilitate an exploration of how such clusters may relate to the semiotic resource formulation of a representation. The data were obtained from a questionnaire given to 1368 students drawn from 12 universities across 7 countries. The questionnaire deals with the refraction of light in introductory-level physics and involves asking students to give their best prediction of the relative visual positioning of images and objects in different semiotically constituted situations. The results of both approaches revealed no one-to-one relationship between a particular representational formulation and a particular cluster of student responses. The factor analysis used correct answer responses to reveal clusters that brought to the fore three different complexity levels in relation to representation formulation. The network analysis used all responses (correct and incorrect) to reveal three structural patterns. What is evident from the results of both analyses is that they confirm two broad conclusions that have emerged from social semiotic explorations dealing with representations in relation to attempting to optimize teaching and learning. The first, which is linked to a facilitating-awareness perspective, is that any given disciplinary visual representation can be expected to evoke a dispersed set of knowledge structures, which is referred to as their relevance structure. Thus, the network analysis results can be seen as presenting a unique starting point for studies aiming to identify such relevance structure. The second broad conclusion is that disciplinary visual representation can and often does contain more disciplinary-relevant aspects than what may be directly visible in a given representation. These are referred to as the appresent aspects that need to become part of the total awareness needed by someone to constitute an intended meaning. The results of the factor analysis can then also be seen to be a way of capturing all the disciplinary-relevant aspects (both present and appresent). Educational implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {[This paper is part of the Focused Collection on Quantitative Methods in PER: A Critical Examination.] The Rasch model is a probabilistic model which describes the interaction of persons (test takers or survey respondents) with test or survey items and is governed by two parameters: item difficulty and person ability. Rasch measurement parallels physical measurement processes by constructing and using linear person and item measures that are independent of the particular characteristics of the sample and the test items along a unidimensional construct. The model’s properties make it especially suitable for test construction and evaluation as well as the development and use of surveys. The evaluation of item fit with the model can pinpoint problematic items and flag idiosyncratic respondents. The possibility of determining sample—independent item difficulties makes it possible to use the Rasch model for linking tests and tracking students’ progression. The use of the Rasch model in PER is continuously increasing. We provide an overview and examples of its use and benefits, and also outline common mistakes or misconceptions made by researchers when considering the use of the Rasch model. We focus in particular on the question of how Rasch modeling can improve some common practices in PER, such as test construction, test evaluation, and calculation of student gain on PER diagnostic instruments., This article appears in the following collection:},

Little attention, in fact, has been given to the underpinnings of this research paradigm. To fill the gap, this theoretical paper addresses key and yet often tacit (or even misunderstood) principles of three commonly used quantitative genres in PER, which I, respectively, refer to as measurement (quantification of individual constructs), controlled exploration of relations (quantification of relationships between multiple constructs through controlled experiments), and data mining (quantification of new information from large datasets). For each genre, I elucidate the paradigmatic basis by focusing on its ontological assumptions (theories about the reality under quantitative investigation), epistemological commitments (views about the knowledge gained through quantitative investigation), and methodological implications for empirical investigations. Although framed in the context of physics education research, the discussions herein are applicable to other discipline-based or general education research employing quantitative methods., This article appears in the following collection:},

	abstract = {This study uses a mixed method sequential exploratory design to examine motivational and contextual influences on boys’ and girls’ engagement in math and science, paying particular attention to similarities and differences in the patterns by gender. First, interviews were conducted with 38 middle and high school students who varied in their level of math and science engagement about their perceptions of the motivational and contextual factors influencing their level of engagement. Both boys and girls discussed how their engagement was higher in classrooms with more student-centered instructional practices and in classrooms with highly engaged peers. Girls were more likely to discuss teacher support and personally relevant instruction as being important to their engagement in math and science. In contrast, boys reported being more engaged in math and science when they were interested in pursuing a STEM-related career. From these interviews, we identified factors that students described as important to their engagement and tested whether these factors were statistically significant in a socioeconomic and racially diverse sample of 3,833 middle and high school students. Specifically, we tested the associations between adolescents’ motivational beliefs (e.g., utility value, attainment value, and expectancy beliefs), social support from teachers and peers, and student-centered and relevant instructional practices with engagement (e.g., cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and social) in math and science, paying particular attention to main effects and gender as a moderator. In the majority of the models, the motivational and contextual factors were significantly related to engagement and had comparable effects for girls and boys. We documented a few significant interactions by gender that tended to mirror the patterns found in the qualitative interviews. Implications of these findings for developing interventions to increase girls’ participation in math and science are discussed. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 55: 271–298, 2018},

This mixed methods study aimed to better understand middle school student engagement and motivation profiles in science by applying latent profile analysis (N = 1828) and student focus group interviews (n = 27). Quantitative results showed five profiles characterized by unique configurations of motivation (self-efficacy, mastery and performance goal orientations) and engagement. Specifically, three profiles (Highly Motivated and Engaged, Average Motivation and Engagement, Below Average Motivation and Engagement) demonstrating level effects and two profiles that demonstrated shape effects (Unmotivated and Disengaged, Mastery Motivated and Engaged) emerged. Grade and school level socioeconomic status were significant predictors of profile membership, and profiles characterized by higher motivation and engagement were associated with higher science achievement. Qualitative findings provided insight into how profile indicators manifest in urban classrooms including how the various motivation and engagement dimensions co-occur as students participate in various science activities. The integration of quantitative profiles and qualitative themes contribute to our understanding of not only how students differ in their motivation and engagement, but also what these profile indicators look like in situ and relate to science learning outcomes. Practical implications for teachers, such as differentiated approaches to support students' unique motivation and engagement needs, are discussed. Finally, lines for future research are outlined, underscoring the affordances of the mixed methods approach in person-centered work.},

	abstract = {During the early grades, female students generally display enthusiasm for learning science. As these same students go though school, however, their level of motivation changes. Once female students reach high school, many lack the confidence to take chemistry and physics. Then, in college they lack the background necessary to major in chemistry, physics, and engineering. This study used quantitative data to investigate the correlation between female students' motivation, self-esteem, and standards-based state science achievement tests combined with a qualitative survey of student's perceptions of parents' attitudes toward science. The Children's Science Motivation Inventory (CAIMI) determined students’ levels of motivation toward science. The Coopersmith Self-esteem Inventory (CSEI) ascertained female students’ overall self-esteem. The ISTEP+ exam given in the 6th grade measured the students’ academic achievement in science. Trained examiners who interviewed students comprised the qualitative component of the study. Each examiner elaborated on selected questions from the CSEI and CAIMI to determine the students’ perceptions of parental attitudes toward science. A multiple regression was used to determine the correlation between self-esteem, motivation, and achievement in science. The correlation was strongest between motivation. Interviews revealed parents and teachers had the most influence on students' perception of science. In understanding the correlation between female students’ motivation, achievement, and self-esteem, schools will gain further knowledge into how students relate to the academic field of science and can thus promote females' participation in more science courses in high school. This then will provide females the necessary background knowledge to pursue a greater number of science majors in college.},

The following study examines 10th‐grade high school students in an attempt to understand and document the influential factors underlying their attitudes towards science studies. The study is conducted through a qualitative research methodology, gathering data based on interviews. This methodology exposes the students’ feelings, views and beliefs, and explores the characteristics of the factors influencing students’ attitudes. Of these factors, we found the most significant for high school students to be interpersonal interaction between teacher and student, the relevance and authenticity of the topics being studied, and the diversity of the teaching methods. We therefore suggest that these three elements should be given particular emphasis by teachers and teacher educators.},

The second, which includes the promotion and prevention orientations posited by regulatory focus theory (Higgins 1997), influences the qualitative relation between motivation and critical-analytic thinking; that is, whether students prefer to engage in critical-analytic thinking over qualitatively distinct modes of processing (such as associative or divergent thinking), which at times may be just as effortful. After describing both kinds of factors, we examine how they are influenced and shaped by a variety of contextual variables. We also consider potential tradeoffs between analytic and associative processing in academic settings and explore the possibility of creating a temporary fit between students’ motivations and the processing demands of a particular task.

The first hypothesis is the broadly shared standard assumption on the relation between individual interest and knowledge: the more an individual is interested in a topic, the more (s)he is willing to engage in learning. An alternative hypothesis assumes that individual interest is not the cause but the consequence of the process of learning: individual interest as an affective by-product of learning.

However, it is less well known that low powered trials tend to systematically exaggerate effect sizes among the subset of interventions that show promising results (p{\textless}α). We conduct a retrospective design analysis to quantify this bias across 22 such promising trials, finding that the estimated effect sizes are exaggerated by an average of 52\% or more. Promising trial bias can be reduced ex-ante by increasing the power of the trials that are commissioned and guarded against ex-post by including estimates of the exaggeration ratio when reporting trial findings. Our results also suggest that challenges around implementation fidelity are not the only reason that apparently successful interventions often fail to subsequently scale up.

	abstract = {The past few years have seen a resurgence of faith in experimentation in education inquiry, and particularly in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Proponents of such research have succeeded in bringing into common parlance the term gold standard, which suggests that research emerging from any other design frame fails to achieve the rigor or significance of RCT-based research in answering causal questions and cannot reliably tell us “what works.” In this article, Gary Thomas questions the reasoning behind this conclusion, resting his argument on the theory and practice of experimentation in education and on the limitations of RCTs in particular. He suggests that the arguments about the power of particular kinds of experiment reside in inappropriate ideas about generalization and induction and, indeed, what a scientific experiment needs to look like. Drawing from examples of systematic inquiry in education and other fields, Thomas argues for a restoration of respect for the heterogeneity of education inquiry.},

	abstract = {Background: The use of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in education has increased significantly over the last 15 years. However, their use has also been subject to sustained and rather trenchant criticism from significant sections of the education research community. Key criticisms have included the claims that: it is not possible to undertake RCTs in education; RCTs are blunt research designs that ignore context and experience; RCTs tend to generate simplistic universal laws of ‘cause and effect’; and that they are inherently descriptive and contribute little to theory. Purpose: This article seeks to assess the above four criticisms of RCTs by considering the actual evidence in relation to the use of RCTs in education in practice. Design and methods: The article is based upon a systematic review that has sought to identify and describe all RCTs conducted in educational settings and including a focus on educational outcomes between 1980 and 2016. The search is limited to articles and reports published in English. Results: The systematic review found a total of 1017 unique RCTs that have been completed and reported between 1980 and 2016. Just over three quarters of these have been produced over the last 10 years, reflecting the significant increase in the use of RCTs in recent years. Overall, just over half of all RCTs identified were conducted in North America and a little under a third in Europe. The RCTs cover a wide range of educational settings and focus on an equally wide range of educational interventions and outcomes. The findings not only disprove the claim that it is not possible to do RCTs in education but also provide some supporting evidence to challenge the other three key criticisms outlined earlier. Conclusions: While providing evidence to counter the four criticisms outlined earlier, the article suggests that there remains significant progress to be made. The article concludes by outlining some key challenges for researchers undertaking RCTs in education.},

	abstract = {Since the 1990s, there have been repeated calls for the systematic use of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to inform educational decision-making. The advent of the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) – described as England’s What Works Centre for Education – in 2011 has made this a reality in England: by 2020, over a third of English schools were involved in such trials. Despite much debate about the value and role of RCTs, less attention has been paid to one specific effect of such trials, a phenomenon we refer to as interventionisation. This article uses two examples, focused on language and literacy education and teacher professional development, to demonstrate how increased use of trials may work to ‘interventionise’ education through channelling the focus of innovation and development to tightly structured interventions and generating a series of narrowing effects. It argues that a broad view of research and a diversity of methodologies is needed not only to generate rich understandings of educational practice but to develop and sustain educational provision that is fit for a dynamic world and which responds to the challenges and opportunities presented in complex educational contexts.},

We describe cognitive aspects of learning as foraging for explanations in the epistemic landscape, the structure (set by instructional design) of which guides the cognitive development through success or failure in foraging. We describe sociodynamic aspects as an agent-based model, where agents (learners) compare and adjust their conceptions of their own proficiency (self-proficiency) and that of their peers (peer-proficiency) in using explanatory schemes of different levels. We apply the model here in a case involving a three-tiered system of explanatory schemes, which can serve as a generic description of some well-known cases studied in empirical research on learning. The cognitive dynamics lead to the formation of dynamically robust outcomes of learning, seen as a strong preference for a certain explanatory schemes. The effects of social learning, however, can account for half of one’s success in adopting higher-level schemes and greater proficiency. The model also predicts a correlation of dynamically emergent interaction patterns between agents and the learning outcomes.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose BiTNet, a real-time object detection network, for enhancing teaching quality and providing feedback through real-time analysis of student behavior in classroom. BiTNet addresses challenges faced by current methods, such as occlusion and small objects in images. Specifically, it incorporates an Efficient Transformer Block (ETB) and Efficient Convolution Aggregation Block (ECAB) for extracting image features. ETB uses convolutional multi-head self-attention (CMHSA) to capture contextual information thus improves the capability to recoginze occluded objects. Its homogeneous multi-branch design reduces the computational costs. The single aggregation operation of ECAB aggregates the extracted features into a single feature map, improving the accuracy of recognition while reducing the computational cost. Then, the semantic and positional information extracted from the backbone are fused in Bi-directional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN). BiTNet also employs a smaller size detection head for recognition of small objects. Experimental results on classroom behavior dataset demonstrate that our proposed method has impressive accuracy (82.9\%) and speed (256.7 FPS on GPU, 30.7 FPS on CPU, and 18.9 on camera). We further experiment with our method on Pascal VOC 2007 and VisDrone2021, validating BiTNet’s generalization and its capability to recognize small objects. In conclusion, BiTNet has a simple yet efficient network structure and feature extraction module, which reduce computational cost while maintaining recognition accuracy, making it a contender for real-time classroom behavior recognition tasks.},

The traditional observation methods rely on human observers, which are short of scalability and objectivity. In this paper, we implement a kind of automatic behavior measurement system, which utilizes the Microsoft Kinect devices to record the students' performance in classroom. Several Kinect devices are installed under the ceiling of one classroom. The facial images of attended students are collected and recognized. The typical gestures of students (such as sitting, raising hand, standing, sleeping and whispering) are also detected and recorded. A queue-based analysis engine is proposed to distinguish the meaningful learning behaviors from those pointless actions. Experiment results show that this system can be utilized to measure the students' active behaviors in typical learning processes, which will be helpful for the analysis of behavioral engagement in classroom teaching.},

Different from traditional motion detection, the hand-raising detection is quite challenging in the real classroom due to complex scenarios, various gestures, and low resolutions. To solve these challenges, we ﬁrst build up a large-scale hand-raising data set from thirty primary schools and middle schools of Shanghai, China. Then we propose an improved R-FCN to solve the above-mentioned challenges. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst design an automatic detection templates algorithm for various gestures of hand-raising detection. Second, for better detection of the small-size hands, we present a feature pyramid to simultaneously capture the detail and highly semantic features. Incorporating these two strategies into a basic R-FCN architecture, our model achieves impressive results on real classroom scenarios. After a wide test, the accuracy of the hand-raising detection achieves 85\% on average, which can satisfy the real application.},

From the simulations, the average increase rate in knowledge, the skewness and kurtosis of knowledge distributions, and grade distributions are determined. These tools make it possible to evaluate the efficiency of teaching strategies and the performance of learning in the classroom. The present model significantly reproduces the phenomenology obtained in Bordogna and Albano (2001), showing first and second-order phase transitions and the temporal dynamics of knowledge. Furthermore, the results of our model allow us to built a gas model analogy. Some of the study cases show characteristics of systems far from the state of thermodynamic equilibrium. This allows us to use the known techniques from gas models to interpret the dynamics of the simulated learning process. The presented model does not describe the teaching–learning process in all its complexity. We use a simple behavioral characteristic of the persons, namely, the inattentional private experience. However, it allows us to prove learning strategies to optimize the learning process. Also, this model is a starting point to propose new models with more elements from neuroscience and sociophysics to study in greater depth the dynamics of the classroom.},

In particular, two main learning processes are considered: the explorative and the transformative learning. To develop the model, the Ising approach, which is a very well established framework to study the dynamics of social interactions, is employed. Furthermore, a simulation analysis is carried out to investigate the effect of two patterns and four levels of social interactions on the firm absorptive capacity. Results show that block-diagonal patterns, where interactions occur inside groups and not between groups (such as in modular organizations), lead to higher absorptive capacity, compared to hierarchical patterns (e.g., those exhibited by centralized organizations). We also show that the relationship between the level of social interactions and the firm absorptive capacity follows an inverted-U shape in the block-diagonal patterns, while the absorptive capacity decreases as the level of interactions rises, in the hierarchical patterns. Finally, we find that the social network also plays a moderating role on the relationship between the complementary knowledge and the firm absorptive capacity.},

This study was designed to assess the long-term eﬀects on students’ conceptual learning as a consequence of an intervention that introduced the 5E model to their teachers ﬁve years earlier. Two questionnaires measuring the prevalence of alternative conceptions about the kinetic-molecular theory were performed over a ﬁve-year interval (pre-test in 2014 and post-test in 2019). 725 students participated, 371 in pre-test and 354 in post-test. In schools where the 5E model was introduced, statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed in the percentage of correct answers between the pre- and post-test in both grades (p = 0.003 and 0.0028, respectively), with Cohen’s d = 0.427 and 0.439, respectively, indicating a relevant eﬀect size, while in control schools no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were reported in either grade. These results provide strong evidence regarding the longterm sustainability of interventions aiming to change teachers’ practices in favor of active learning methods such as the 5E model and their positive eﬀects on students’ conceptual learning.},

In addition, classroom experiences (felt recognition as a scientist and perceived classroom climate) and changes over a 10-week academic term in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) identity and motivation were tested as mediators. The sample comprised 1,079 undergraduate students from introductory biology classrooms (65.4\% women, 37.6\% Asian, 30.2\% White, 25.1\% Latinx). Using structural equation modeling (SEM), our hypothesized model was confirmed while controlling for class size and GPA. Performing science practices (e.g., hypothesizing or explaining results) positively predicted students' felt recognition as a scientist; and felt recognition positively predicted perceived classroom climate. In turn, felt recognition and classroom climate predicted increases over time in students' STEM motivation (expectancy-value beliefs), STEM identity, and STEM career aspirations. Finally, these factors predicted students' course grade. Both recognition as a scientist and positive classroom climate were more strongly related to outcomes among underrepresented minority (URM) students. Findings have implications for why large-format courses that emphasize opportunities for students to learn science practices are related to positive STEM outcomes, as well as why they may prove especially helpful for URM students. Practical implications include the importance of recognition as a scientist from professors, teaching assistants, and classmates in addition to curriculum that engages students in the authentic practices of science.},

The purpose of this study was to illuminate sources of motivation from and resistance to active learning that resulted from a novel, exemplary active-learning approach rooted in essential science practices and supported by science education literature. This approach was enacted over the course of 4 weeks in eight sections of an introductory undergraduate biology laboratory course.

Qualitative analysis of open-response questionnaires and interviews elucidated sources of motivation and resistance that resulted from this active-learning approach. Several participants indicated this approach enhanced interest, creativity, and motivation to prepare, and resulted in a challenging learning environment that facilitated the sharing of diverse perspectives and the development of a community of learners. Sources of resistance to active learning included participants’ unfamiliarity with essential science practices, having to struggle with uncertainty in the absence of authoritative information, and the extra effort required to actively construct knowledge as compared to learning via traditional, teacher-centered instruction. Implications for implementation, including tips for reducing student resistance to active learning, are discussed.},

	abstract = {This study validated an instrument for measuring student engagement in the context of Chinese science curriculum reforms. We adapted existing items from well-designed instruments with the context of science learning and formed the initial instrument of the Student Engagement in Science Learning (SESL) consisting of 20 items in four subscales, including cognitive, emotional, behavioural, and agentic engagement. We recruited an expert panel to provide content and face validity during the adaptation process. The final sample of 578 was collected and analysed to provide the construct validity of the SESL instrument. The results from item analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, correlation analysis conformed the instrument's convergent and discriminant validity. Independent t-tests of gender and district groups confirmed the concurrent validity of the instrument. The Cronbach's coefficient alpha of the four subscales and the total scale are higher than 0.70, indicating the SESL instrument has the internal consistency reliability for measuring student engagement in science learning. Researchers and practitioners would benefit from the valid and reliable SESL instrument with the four constructs to measure and improve student engagement in science learning.},

	abstract = {This study examines the association between student situational engagement and classroom activities in secondary school science classrooms in Finland and the U.S. Situational engagement is conceptualised as times when students feel that a task is interesting and challenging to them and that they have the skills to complete it (see Schneider et al., 2016. Investigating optimal learning moments in U.S. and Finnish science classes. Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 53(3), 400–421. doi:10.1002/tea.21306). Data on situational engagement and classroom activities were obtained using the experience sampling method (ESM) from 247 Finnish students in 13 secondary science classrooms and 281 U.S. students in 18 secondary science classrooms. In both samples, the students tended to be situationally engaged only a small proportion of the time during their science classes. However, the Finnish students were more likely than the U.S. students to report being situationally engaged. To investigate when the students were most likely to report being situationally engaged, hierarchical logistic regression models were employed, which suggested that some classroom activities were associated with higher levels of student situational engagement than others. The Finnish students were more likely to report being situationally engaged when calculating and presenting scientific information. In the U.S., the students were more likely to report being situationally engaged while discussing scientific information and less likely when listening to the teacher. The results suggest that situational engagement is momentary and associated with specific science classroom activities.},

	abstract = {Background: Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the factors related to science achievement. In these studies, the classroom goal structure perceptions, engagement, and self-efficacy of the students have emerged as important factors to be examined in relation to students’ science achievement. Purpose: This study examines the relationships between classroom goal structure perception variables (motivating tasks, autonomy support, and mastery evaluation), engagement (behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and agentic engagement), self-efficacy, and science achievement. Sample: The study participants included 744 seventh-grade students from 9 public schools in two districts of Gaziantep in Turkey. Design and methods: Data were collected through the administration of four instruments: Survey of Classroom Goals Structures, Engagement Questionnaire, Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire, and Science Achievement Test. The obtained data were subjected to path analysis to test the proposed model. Results: Students’ perceptions of classroom goal structures (i.e. motivating tasks, autonomy support, and mastery evaluation) were found to be significant predictors of their self-efficacy. Autonomy support was observed to be positively linked to all aspects of engagement, while motivating tasks were found to be related only to cognitive engagement. In addition, mastery evaluation was shown to be positively linked to engagement variables, except for cognitive engagement, and self-efficacy and engagement (i.e. behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement) were observed to be significant predictors of science achievement. Finally, results revealed reciprocal relations among engagement variables, except for agentic engagement. Conclusions: Students who perceive mastery goal structures tend to show higher levels of engagement and self-efficacy in science classes. The study found that students who have high self-efficacy and who are behaviorally, emotionally, and cognitively engaged are more successful in science classes. Accordingly, it is recommended that science teachers utilize inquiry-based and hands-on science activities in science classes and focus on the personal improvement of the students. Furthermore, it is also recommended that they provide students with opportunities to make their own choices and decisions and to control their own actions in science classes.},

However, there is little agreement on a concrete definition and effective measurement of engagement. This special issue serves to discuss and work toward addressing conceptual and instrumentation issues related to engagement, with particular interest in engagement in the domain of science learning. We start by describing the dimensional perspective of engagement (behavioral, cognitive, emotional, agentic) and suggest a complementary approach that places engagement instrumentation on a continuum. Specifically, we recommend that instrumentation be considered on a “grain-size” continuum that ranges from a person-centered to a context-centered orientation to clarify measurement issues. We then provide a synopsis of the articles included in this special issue and conclude with suggestions for future research.},

A survey by Malaysia’s Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) found that 80\% of the participating schools fell into the poor performance bracket. However, studies in this line of research are limited and scattered. To provide a clear insight into this problem and support researchers, it is crucial to understand the current state of research in this area.

We demonstrate how ChatGPT can be instructed through a gamification environment to define and benchmark hypothetical physical theories. Through this environment, ChatGPT successfully simulates the creation of a new improved model, called GPT4, which combines the concepts of GPT in AI (generative pretrained transformer) and GPT in physics (generalized probabilistic theory). We show that GPT4 can use its built-in mathematical and statistical capabilities to simulate and analyze physical laws and phenomena. As a demonstration of its language capabilities, GPT4 also generates a limerick about itself. Overall, our results demonstrate the promising potential for human-AI collaboration in scientific discovery, as well as the importance of designing systems that effectively integrate AI's capabilities with human intelligence.},

	url = {http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/7457},
	abstract = {This thesis explores the ways in which suspension of disbelief works in digital games. Primarily concerned with how players relate imaginatively to the often major dissonance between gameplay and narrative in digital games, this thesis questions how the literate players of games reconcile these complex texts imaginatively. Proposing that Samuel Taylor Coleridge's concept of suspension of disbelief is a complicated process often cited rhetorically rather than given its theoretical due, this thesis aims to rehabilitate the term and turn it into a useful, sharpened tool for games studies. Digital games themselves are also seen to be an intense new realm of possibilities for the suspension of disbelief, and textual analysis of games which approach the fourth wall or the suspension of disbelief on their own terms helps to make this clear. 
Beginning by defining the differences of games compared to other media, the thesis goes on to define suspension of disbelief in both its historical and modern contexts and see how it fits with games, isolating three key problems with uniting the concept with the medium. The three chapters which follow looked in more depth at the problems of the skilled reader, fundamental activity and dissonance through investigations into games’ textual construction, the mindsets they engender in players and their reformulation of the fourth wall. The final section looks at the conclusions working together to achieve the dual aims of proposing a new model for game reading which centres around a willed disavowal of presence on the part of the gamer combined with the gamer's taking up of a role offered by the game-text, and rehabilitating both the term and the concept of suspension of disbelief.},

During this game, the students had the opportunity to act as different stakeholders. In order to assess the impact of this game on participants’ thoughts of who might be affected by a flood event, two questionnaires were used, one before and one after the game. The results show that there was very positive feedback from the participants on how this RPG helped them realize the different implications a flood event might have on citizens and decision makers. The community-based aspect that was chosen for this RPG implementation showed the difficulties the specific roles would face as single individuals and as a community in general. Using a similar approach can help any stakeholder understand the challenges in a more direct way than with traditional lecturing and presentations.},

However, in educational games, such a state only is reached trough the combination of both, which is barely obtained by most of them. In this sense this paper proposes a foundational set of good practices for Educational Game Design, aiming to serve as a conceptual framework to support game designers, content creators and teachers/professors in this intrinsically multidisciplinary task, which is to seamlessly integrate narrative elements with game mechanics, dynamics and learning goals.},

The findings reveal that generative language models such as ChatGPT can provide specific materials and support mechanisms, such as lesson plans, to schoolteachers and student teachers. It also showed that ChatGPT has levelled the playing field by opening access to lesson plans to all teachers. However, to unleash their full potential for education, it is crucial to approach these models with caution and critically evaluate their limitations and potential biases, understanding that they are tools to support teaching and learning and do not replace teachers. The study’s contribution lies in ChatGPT-generated lesson plans’ implications and the enhancement of critical thinking for teacher education, and it also underscores the need for further research to explore best practices for integrating ChatGPT in lesson planning.},

This study was designed to assess the long-term eﬀects on students’ conceptual learning as a consequence of an intervention that introduced the 5E model to their teachers ﬁve years earlier. Two questionnaires measuring the prevalence of alternative conceptions about the kinetic-molecular theory were performed over a ﬁve-year interval (pre-test in 2014 and post-test in 2019). 725 students participated, 371 in pre-test and 354 in post-test. In schools where the 5E model was introduced, statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed in the percentage of correct answers between the pre- and post-test in both grades (p = 0.003 and 0.0028, respectively), with Cohen’s d = 0.427 and 0.439, respectively, indicating a relevant eﬀect size, while in control schools no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were reported in either grade. These results provide strong evidence regarding the longterm sustainability of interventions aiming to change teachers’ practices in favor of active learning methods such as the 5E model and their positive eﬀects on students’ conceptual learning.},

In addition, classroom experiences (felt recognition as a scientist and perceived classroom climate) and changes over a 10-week academic term in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) identity and motivation were tested as mediators. The sample comprised 1,079 undergraduate students from introductory biology classrooms (65.4\% women, 37.6\% Asian, 30.2\% White, 25.1\% Latinx). Using structural equation modeling (SEM), our hypothesized model was confirmed while controlling for class size and GPA. Performing science practices (e.g., hypothesizing or explaining results) positively predicted students' felt recognition as a scientist; and felt recognition positively predicted perceived classroom climate. In turn, felt recognition and classroom climate predicted increases over time in students' STEM motivation (expectancy-value beliefs), STEM identity, and STEM career aspirations. Finally, these factors predicted students' course grade. Both recognition as a scientist and positive classroom climate were more strongly related to outcomes among underrepresented minority (URM) students. Findings have implications for why large-format courses that emphasize opportunities for students to learn science practices are related to positive STEM outcomes, as well as why they may prove especially helpful for URM students. Practical implications include the importance of recognition as a scientist from professors, teaching assistants, and classmates in addition to curriculum that engages students in the authentic practices of science.},

Sources of resistance to active learning included participants’ unfamiliarity with essential science practices, having to struggle with uncertainty in the absence of authoritative information, and the extra effort required to actively construct knowledge as compared to learning via traditional, teacher-centered instruction. Implications for implementation, including tips for reducing student resistance to active learning, are discussed.},

With proper pedagogy, students can experience real physics, and they can benefit tremendously from feeling like actual scientists. As a result, I’ve helped develop the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE) approach to learning and teaching physics.1 Below I introduce it and demonstrate how it both deals with Andrew’s concerns and addresses what I believe are the major challenges facing physics education in the 21st century.Many years ago, Andrew, one of the best students in my introductory physics course, said to me, “I know how to get a good grade in physics, but I feel like what we do in class can’t be what physicists do when they do physics. I wonder what they actually do.” That comment got me thinking: Is it possible for a student to experience real physics while learning it? Is it important when you are taking an introductory physics course to know and feel like you are doing what physicists do?},

These articles represent more than just a repository of past work: they have the potential to offer insights into both the history of science education as well as well as the dynamics of field-specific change. It can be difficult, however, for educators, researchers, reformers, and policymakers to grasp the nuances of over 100 years of scholarship given the overwhelming amount of textual material. To address this problem, we have used latent Dirichlet allocation, an automated machine-learning algorithm from the field of natural language processing, to perform an automated literature review and classification of the corpus of work in Science Education. Using this technique, we have classified research in the journal into 21 distinct topics, falling into three thematic groups: science content topics, teaching-focused topics, and student-focused topics. We have also quantified the rise and fall of these topics and groups over time, and used them to begin to extract insight into the development of the field, including the effects of national policy changes on topics of interest to the research community, the interrelationships between different research topics, and the effects of intellectual cross-pollination. Based on this analysis, we argue that this technique shows great promise for even larger-scale analyses of educational literature and other textual data.},

	abstract = {Social interactions among humans create complex networks and – despite a recent increase of online communication – the interactions mediated through physical proximity remain a fundamental way for people to connect. A common way to quantify the nature of the links between individuals is to consider repeated interactions: frequently occurring interactions indicate strong ties, such as friendships, while ties with low weights can indicate random encounters. Here we focus on a different dimension: rather than the strength of links, we study physical distance between individuals when a link is activated. The findings presented here are based on a dataset of proximity events in a population of approximately 500 individuals. To quantify the impact of the physical proximity on the dynamic network, we use a simulated epidemic spreading processes in two distinct networks of physical proximity. We consider the network of short-range interactions defined as d \$\$\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{{\textbackslash}lesssim \}\}\$\$ 1 meter, and the long-range which includes all interactions d \$\$\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{{\textbackslash}lesssim \}\}\$\$ 10 meters. Since these two networks arise from the same set of underlying behavioral data, we are able to quantitatively measure how the specific definition of the proximity network – short-range versus long-range – impacts the resulting network structure as well as spreading dynamics in epidemic simulations. We find that the short-range network – consistent with the literature – is characterized by densely-connected neighborhoods bridged by weak ties. More surprisingly, however, we show that spreading in the long-range network is quite different, mainly shaped by spurious interactions.},

While the centrality univariate effects are significant for student performance, only being a prestigious friend remains important when peer performance is taken into account.},

The current study examined 349 9th–12th graders from a single US school using a questionnaire assessing students’ social status, popularity goals, academic achievement goals, and mindset as well as overall GPA and language arts achievement. The results suggest that social status and popularity goals have different academic motivation and achievement outcomes, with social status relating to achievement and popularity goals aligning with performance goals.

It is thus surprising that the function of photographs and their relation to captions and texts have not been the topic of analysis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence, function, and structure of photographs in high school science. Our motivating research question was, “What can students learn from textbooks when they study photographs?” To answer this and several subordinate questions, we selected and analyzed four Brazilian biology textbooks. We focus on the use of photographs and the relation among them, various types of texts, and the subject matter presented. Our analysis reveals that the structural elements of text, caption, and photographs and the relations among them differ across the textbooks and at times even within the same book. This, of course, will influence readers' interpretations of the photographs changing their role in the text. The results of our study have implications for textbook authors and textbook readers. We suggest that future studies may focus on students' and teachers' interpretation of photographs in real time. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 40: 1089–1114, 2003},

I first describe the heuristic principles for setting up a research group, including (i) common topic and multiple disciplines, (ii) open culture, (iii) spatial proximity, and (iv) temporal proximity. Then I describe heuristics for maintaining the open culture, such as setting collective goals, including contrarians, distributing responsibility, making bets, the cake rule, and side-by-side writing. These heuristics form an “adaptive toolbox” that shapes the intellectual and social climate. They create a culture of friendly but rigorous discussion, embedded in a family-like climate of trust where everyone is willing to expose their ignorance and learn from the other members. Feeling accepted and trusted encourages taking the necessary risks to achieve progress in science.},

They are therefore important in the conduct and learning of science, given the central commitment of that discipline to providing evidence-based explanations of natural phenomena, in which underlying entities and mechanisms have to be postulated and substantiated on the basis of empirical enquiry. The three generic types of representation and the modes in which they are expressed are presented against the background of an established model of their acquisition, processing and display. The two meanings of ‘visualization’ are discussed as is the key role played by fluency in them in the attainment of expert status in the processes of science. The nature and origins of students’ problems in attaining this ‘metavisual competence’ are derived from a review of the literature. Good practice in the teaching of the conventions of representation is suggested. Specific research and development is needed if this key aspect of knowledge acquisition and display is to be fully recognised in the varied curricula of formal science education and in the provision of opportunities for the informal communication of science.},

In response to the introduction of the revised National Curriculum in September 2014, teachers and the school head engaged in a critical discourse around their perceptions of students’ attainment and engagement across the curriculum, and explored alternative curriculum design and pedagogies. Supported by ‘academic partners’, teachers were introduced to the ‘Storyline’ approach and encouraged to consider a shift from a rigid and functional curriculum towards more flexible approaches which emphasise problem solving, critical literacy and communication in multiple form. The argument presented here is twofold: first, it is suggested that moving towards more ‘open architectures’ improves students’ engagement with learning by reducing teaching to the test and creating more socially responsive and real-life learning experiences; this is then contrasted with current ‘top-down’ models of prescriptive curriculum design tied to a raft of high-stakes standardised tests which constrains teachers’ efforts to engage in this process.},

I identify key gaps for further research and propose implications from this research for teaching practice.

Assuming this discrepancy between results (i.e., lack of differentiation vs. nuanced complexity) might be an artifact of this particular observational protocol rather than a reflection of reality, this study microanalyzed the source material influencing adolescent and adult evaluative assessments of classroom management, using transcripts generated from video viewing sessions. Comparisons between (a) adolescents? indigenous interpretations, and (b) adults? trained interpretations of CLASS-S classroom management instructional interactions suggest that adolescents view student engagement and positive climate as particularly relevant to assessments of classroom management, whereas the CLASS-S does not include these as dimensions of effective teaching assessed as part of the Classroom Organization domain.},

	abstract = {Skill with different representations and multiple representations is highly valued in physics, and prior work has shown that novice physics students can struggle with the representations typically used in solving physics problems. There exists work in PER examining student use of representations and multiple representations, but there have been no comprehensive attempts to understand what factors influence how introductory students succeed or fail in using representations in physics. This thesis is such an attempt, and is organized around four main goals and results. First, we establish that representation is a major factor in student performance, and uncover some of the mechanisms by which representation can affect performance, including representation-dependent cueing. Second, we study the effect of different instructional environments on student learning of multiple representation use during problem solving, and find that courses that are rich in representations can have significant impacts on student skills. Third, we evaluate the role of meta-representational skills in solving physics problems at the introductory level, and find that the meta-representational abilities that we test for in our studies are poorly developed in introductory students. Fourth, we characterize the differences in representation use between expert and novice physics problem solvers, and note that the major differences appear not to lie in whether representations are used, but in how they are used.
With these results in hand, we introduce a model of student use of representations during physics problem solving. This model consists of a set of practical heuristics plus an analysis framework adapted from cultural-constructivist theory. We demonstrate that this model can be useful in understanding and synthesizing our results, and we discuss the instructional implications of our findings.},

	abstract = {One of the major focuses in the PER community has been on understanding student learning in order to improve how we teach undergraduate physics courses. Problem-solving receives significant emphasis across the undergraduate physics curriculum, and students’ ability to solve physics problems has been researched extensively. Studying student problem- solving processes in upper-division physics courses is a growing area of research. The research presented in this dissertation is done in an effort to understand student problem-solving processes at the upper-division level. In particular, we investigate students’ use of mathematical tools across the undergraduate physics curriculum, in particular, at intermediate mechanics students’ written homework solutions in order to better understand how students use these tools as they solve traditional mechanics problems. We use a modified version of the ACER (Activation-Construction-Execution-Reflection) framework to analyze students’ solutions and to identify patterns of mathematical skill use on traditional problems. We apply techniques borrowed from network analysis and the Resources Framework to build a “fingerprint” of students’ mathematical tool use. In this study, we present preliminary findings on patterns that we have identified in students’ problem-solving.
Then we shift our focus to investigate how students use multiple representations as they solve problems. First, we study how students translate among different representations. Data for this study is drawn from an upper-division Electromagnetism I course, where students engaged in individual oral exams. We do a moment-by-moment analysis of students’ problem solving to see how they translate among durable representations (diagrams, written mathematical equations) with the help of evanescent representations (gestures, words), and how students build up durable representations where they can “stand fast” later. In this study, we present the case of Larry as an exemplary case for problem-solving. Larry starts from a durable representation (a diagram). He then builds from there, using evanescent representations (gestures and words) and standing fast on the diagram. He later translates to a different kind of durable representation (mathematics), where he reasons and answers the original problem.
In our investigation to understand how students use multiple representations while solving problems, we further investigate how students construct spontaneous representations and also make connections among these representations. We use a social semiotic perspective to sketch a theoretical framework that accounts for how semiotic resources might be combined to solve problems. We identify the semiotic and conceptual resources that Larry uses, and we use a resource-graph representation to show Larry’s coordination of resources in his problem- solving activity. Larry’s case exemplifies coordination between multiple semiotic resources with different disciplinary affordances to build up compound representations. Our analysis of this case illustrates a novel way to think about how students use semiotic resources as they solve physics problems.
After that, we revise our theoretical framework to better describe students connecting multimodal representations. The revised framework focuses on the semiotic modes and it describes how students coordinate among different semiotic resources with different modes. In this study, we use multiple cases of students solving oral-exam problems to generalize the approach.},

Pilot studies demonstrate that representations (e.g., diagrams) can play a key role in students' use of analogy. A new model of analogy, Analogical Scaffolding, is developed to explain these initial empirical results. This model will be described in detail, and then applied to describe and predict the outcomes of further experiments. Two large-scale (N{\textgreater}100) studies will demonstrate that: (1) students taught with analogies, according to the Analogical Scaffolding model, outperform students taught without analogies on pre-post assessments focused on electromagnetic waves; (2) the representational forms used to teach with analogy can play a significant role in student learning, with students in one treatment group outperforming students in other treatment groups by factors of two or three. It will be demonstrated that Analogical Scaffolding can be used to predict these results, as well as finer-grained results such as the types of distracters students choose in different treatment groups, and to describe and analyze student reasoning in interviews. Abstraction in physics is reconsidered using Analogical Scaffolding. An operational definition of abstraction is developed within the Analogical Scaffolding framework and employed to explain (a) why physicists consider some ideas more abstract than others in physics, and (b) how students conceptions of these ideas can be modeled. This new approach to abstraction suggests novel approaches to curriculum design in physics using Analogical Scaffolding.},

More specifically, the authors used CFA to test three different factor models on several correlation matrices of exploratively obtained factor structures that were reported in the literature. The factor models varied with respect to the role of the smaller factor pattern coefficients. Results showed that confirmatory factor models in which all low EFA pattern coefficients were fixed to zero fitted especially poorly. The authors conclude that it may be justified to use a less constrained model when testing a factor model by allowing some correlation among the factors and some of the lower factor pattern coefficients to differ from zero.},

	abstract = {In confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), the use of maximum likelihood (ML) assumes that the observed indicators follow a continuous and multivariate normal distribution, which is not appropriate for ordinal observed variables. Robust ML (MLR) has been introduced into CFA models when this normality assumption is slightly or moderately violated. Diagonally weighted least squares (WLSMV), on the other hand, is specifically designed for ordinal data. Although WLSMV makes no distributional assumptions about the observed variables, a normal latent distribution underlying each observed categorical variable is instead assumed. A Monte Carlo simulation was carried out to compare the effects of different configurations of latent response distributions, numbers of categories, and sample sizes on model parameter estimates, standard errors, and chi-square test statistics in a correlated two-factor model. The results showed that WLSMV was less biased and more accurate than MLR in estimating the factor loadings across nearly every condition. However, WLSMV yielded moderate overestimation of the interfactor correlations when the sample size was small or/and when the latent distributions were moderately nonnormal. With respect to standard error estimates of the factor loadings and the interfactor correlations, MLR outperformed WLSMV when the latent distributions were nonnormal with a small sample size of N = 200. Finally, the proposed model tended to be over-rejected by chi-square test statistics under both MLR and WLSMV in the condition of small sample size N = 200.},

Social semiotics is a broad construct where all communication in a particular social group is realized through the use of semiotic resources. In the discipline of physics, examples of such semiotic resources are graphs, diagrams, mathematics, spoken and written language, and laboratory apparatus. In physics education research it is usual to refer to most of these semiotic resources as representations. In social semiotics, then, disciplinary learning can be viewed as coming to interpret and use the meaning potential of disciplinary-specific semiotic resources (representations) that has been assigned by the discipline. We use this complementary depiction of representations to build theory with respect to the construction and sharing of disciplinary knowledge in the teaching and learning of university physics. To facilitate both scholarly discussion and future research in the area, a number of theoretical constructs have been developed. These constructs take their point of departure in empirical studies of teaching and learning in undergraduate physics. In the chapter we present each of these constructs in turn and examine their usefulness for problematizing teaching and learning with multiple representations in university physics.},

	abstract = {Education is increasingly being framed by a competence mindset; the value of knowledge lies much more in competence performativity and innovation than in simply knowing. Reaching such competency in areas such as astronomy and physics has long been known to be challenging. The movement from everyday conceptions of the world around us to a disciplinary interpretation is fraught with pitfalls and problems. Thus, what underpins the characteristics of the disciplinary trajectory to competence becomes an important educational consideration. In this article we report on a study involving what students and lecturers discern from the same disciplinary semiotic resource. We use this to propose an Anatomy of Disciplinary Discernment (ADD), a hierarchy of what is focused on and how it is interpreted in an appropriate, disciplinary manner, as an overarching fundamental aspect of disciplinary learning. Students and lecturers in astronomy and physics were asked to describe what they could discern from a video simulation of travel through our Galaxy and beyond. In all, 137 people from nine countries participated. The descriptions were analysed using a hermeneutic interpretive study approach. The analysis resulted in the formulation of five qualitatively different categories of discernment; the ADD, reflecting a view of participants’ competence levels. The ADD reveals four increasing levels of disciplinary discernment: Identification, Explanation, Appreciation, and Evaluation. This facilitates the identification of a clear relationship between educational level and the level of disciplinary discernment. The analytical outcomes of the study suggest how teachers of science, after using the ADD to assess the students disciplinary knowledge, may attain new insights into how to create more effective learning environments by explicitly crafting their teaching to support the crossing of boundaries in the ADD model.},

	abstract = {A social semiotic lens is used to characterise aspects of representational competence for a discipline such as physics, to provide science teachers with a practical suggestion about how student learning might be organised to develop representational competence. We suggest that representational competence for some areas of science can be characterised in terms of the ability to appropriately interpret and produce a set of disciplinary-scientiﬁc representations of real-world phenomena, and link these to scientiﬁc concepts. This is because many areas of science are based on creating scientiﬁc explanations of real-world observations. We then show how this characterisation may be applied by performing a social semiotic audit of what it entails to become representationally competent in one particular semiotic system (graphs) for one particular area of physics (1-D kinematics). Using this audit, we generate three open-ended tasks expected to help students develop representational competence in this area and empirically demonstrate their potential eﬀectiveness. Building on this example, we suggest that our description of how a disciplinary social semiotic audit may be used to construct open-ended student learning tasks potentially provides one way for teachers to think about the development of representational competence in other semiotic systems and other areas of science.},

A growing body of research suggests that the representations we use in physics are important in such learning environments. In this paper we draw on a number of sources in the literature to explore the role of representations in interactive engagement in physics. In particular we are interested in the potential for sharing disciplinary knowledge inherent in so-called persistent representations (such as equations, diagrams and graphs), which we use in physics. We use selected extracts from a case study, where a group of senior undergraduate physics students are asked to explain the phenomenon of refraction, to illustrate implications for interactive engagement. In this study the ray diagram that was initially introduced by the students did not appear to sufficiently support their interactive engagement. However, the introduction of a wavefront diagram quickly led their discussion to an agreed conclusion. From our analysis we conclude that in interactive engagement it is important to choose appropriate persistent representations to coordinate the use of other representations such as speech and gestures. Pedagogical implications and future research are proposed.},

	abstract = {A significant step in space exploration during the 21st century will be human settlement on Mars. Instead of transporting all the construction materials from Earth to the red planet with incredibly high cost, using Martian soil to construct a site on Mars is a superior choice. Knowing that Mars has long been considered a “sulfur-rich planet”, a new construction material composed of simulated Martian soil and molten sulfur is developed. In addition to the raw material availability for producing sulfur concrete and a strength reaching similar or higher levels of conventional cementitious concrete, fast curing, low temperature sustainability, acid and salt environment resistance, 100\% recyclability are appealing superior characteristics of the developed Martian Concrete. In this study, different percentages of sulfur are investigated to obtain the optimal mixing proportions. Three point bending, unconfined compression and splitting tests were conducted to determine strength development, strength variability, and failure mechanisms. The test results show that the strength of Martian Concrete doubles that of sulfur concrete utilizing regular sand. It is also shown that the particle size distribution plays an important role in the mixture’s final strength. Furthermore, since Martian soil is metal rich, sulfates and, potentially, polysulfates are also formed during high temperature mixing, which might contribute to the high strength. The optimal mix developed as Martian Concrete has an unconfined compressive strength of above 50MPa. The formulated Martian Concrete is simulated by the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM), which exhibits excellent ability in modeling the material response under various loading conditions.},

Networks and clustering methods have become important tools to comprehend instances of these large-scale structures, but without methods to distinguish between real trends and noisy data, these approaches are not useful for studying how networks change. Only if we can assign significance to the partitioning of single networks can we distinguish meaningful structural changes from random fluctuations. Here we show that bootstrap resampling accompanied by significance clustering provides a solution to this problem. To connect changing structures with the changing function of networks, we highlight and summarize the significant structural changes with alluvial diagrams and realize de Solla Price's vision of mapping change in science: studying the citation pattern between about 7000 scientific journals over the past decade, we find that neuroscience has transformed from an interdisciplinary specialty to a mature and stand-alone discipline.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Many algorithms have been proposed but it is not yet clear how they should be tested. Recently we have proposed a general class of undirected and unweighted benchmark graphs, with heterogeneous distributions of node degree and community size. An increasing attention has been recently devoted to develop algorithms able to consider the direction and the weight of the links, which require suitable benchmark graphs for testing. In this paper we extend the basic ideas behind our previous benchmark to generate directed and weighted networks with built-in community structure. We also consider the possibility that nodes belong to more communities, a feature occurring in real systems, such as social networks. As a practical application, we show how modularity optimization performs on our benchmark.},

Many real-world networks are sparse and hierarchical, with m∼n and d∼logn, in which case our algorithm runs in essentially linear time, O(nlog2n). As an example of the application of this algorithm we use it to analyze a network of items for sale on the web site of a large on-line retailer, items in the network being linked if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer. The network has more than 400 000 vertices and 2×106 edges.

This collection of essays, assembled by Marjorie Grene, exemplifies the development of Polanyi’s theory of knowledge which was first presented in Science, Faith, and Society and later systematized in Personal Knowledge.
 
Polanyi believes that the dilemma of the modern mind arises from the peculiar relation between the positivist claim for total objectivity in scientific knowledge and the unprecedented moral dynamism characterizing the social and political aspirations of the last century. The first part of Knowing and Being deals with this theme. Part two develops Polanyi’s idea that centralization is incompatible with the life of science as well as his views on the role of tradition and authority in science. The essays on tacit knowing in Part Three proceed directly from his preoccupation with the nature of scientific discovery and reveal a pervasive substructure of all intelligent behavior. Polanyi believes that all knowing involves movement from internal clues to external evidence. Therefore, to explain the process of knowing, we must develop a theory of the nature of living things in general, including an account of that aspect of living things we call “mind.” Part Four elaborates upon this theme.},

	abstract = {In this paper we exemplify how a social semiotic approach to pupils’ multimodal texts (texts which draw on and make available to the senses a range of resources, including the visual, material, and actional) can provide a way into understanding learning. We suggest that learning can be seen as a transformative process of sign making. Specifically, we suggest that materiality (use of frame, shape, texture, colour, and imported objects) can be seen as one expression of how pupils engage with knowledge and learning. In order to demonstrate this we focus on year seven (11 year old) pupils’ visual representations of cells in two science classrooms at a London girls school. We argue that the range of representational resources available within visual communication (spatial relations, materiality, etc.) enabled the expression of kinds of meaning which would have been difficult, or perhaps impossible, in language. We conclude that visual and linguistic modes of expression have different potentials for meaning making, and therefore different potentials for learning.},

The critical words here are "understand" and "concept", and both of these terms assume a fundamentally psychological approach to learning. They belong to the tradition of mentalism, in which concepts are mental
objects and understanding is a mental process. In more modern terms, they belong to a cognitive model of
science education. I do not believe that this kind of theoretical model can tell us enough to help us to become better teachers of science. I believe that it lacks the necessary vocabulary to tell us just what we must lead students to do in order to learn to reason and act scientifically.},

	abstract = {In this chapter we describe an interactive method of teaching, Investigative Science
Learning Environment (ISLE), that helps students learn physics by engaging in proc-
esses that mirror the activities of physicists when they construct and apply knowl-
edge. These processes involve observing, finding patterns, building and testing ex-
planations of the patterns, and using multiple representations to reason about physical
phenomena. ISLE is a comprehensive learning system that provides a general phi-
losophy and specific activities that can be used in “lectures” (interactive meetings
where students construct and test ideas), recitations (where students learn to represent
them in multiple ways while solving problems) and labs (where students learn to de-
sign their own experiments to test hypotheses and solve practical problems). In ISLE,
students are assessed for conceptual understanding, for problem-solving ability, and,
most importantly, for their use of various scientific abilities. We have developed ac-
tivities that help students acquire some of the abilities used by scientists in their
work: experiment design, model building, use of multiple-representations, evaluation, etc. To determine the degree to which the students have acquired these abilities and to simultaneously provide feedback to the students, we have developed a set of rubrics that can be used by instructors for grading and by the students for self assessment. In this chapter we also provide a theoretical basis for the ISLE structure (using brain and cognitive research), explain how this learning system addresses the needs of the 21st century science education and workplace, and how it is different from other reformed curricula.},

They are one of the most fundamental types of stochastic processes; can be used to model numerous phenomena, including diffusion, interactions, and opinions among humans and animals; and can be used to extract information about important entities or dense groups of entities in a network. Random walks have been studied for many decades on both regular lattices and (especially in the last couple of decades) on networks with a variety of structures. In the present article, we survey the theory and applications of random walks on networks, restricting ourselves to simple cases of single and non-adaptive random walkers. We distinguish three main types of random walks: discrete-time random walks, node-centric continuous-time random walks, and edge-centric continuous-time random walks. We first briefly survey random walks on a line, and then we consider random walks on various types of networks. We extensively discuss applications of random walks, including ranking of nodes (e.g., PageRank), community detection, respondent-driven sampling, and opinion models such as voter models.},

Multiple quantitative methods have been employed to analyze commonly used mechanics conceptual inventories: the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) and the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE). Recently, researchers have applied network analytic techniques to explore the structure of the incorrect responses to the FCI identifying communities of incorrect responses which could be mapped on to common misconceptions. In this study, the method used to analyze the FCI, modified module analysis was applied to a large sample of FMCE pretest and post-test responses (Npre=3956, Npost=3719). The communities of incorrect responses identified were consistent with the item groups described in previous works. As in the work with the FCI, the network was simplified by only retaining nodes selected by a substantial number of students. Retaining as nodes only those incorrect answer choices selected by at least 20\% of the students produced communities associated with only four misconceptions. The incorrect response communities identified for men and women were substantially different, as was the change in these communities from pretest to post-test. The 20\% threshold was far more restrictive than the 4\% threshold applied to the FCI in the prior work that generated similar structures. Retaining nodes selected by 5\% or 10\% of students generated a large number of complex communities. The communities identified at the 10\% threshold were generally associated with common misconceptions producing a far richer set of incorrect communities than the FCI; this may indicate that the FMCE is a superior instrument for characterizing the breadth of student misconceptions about Newtonian mechanics.},

This method analyzed the network structure of the correlation matrix of the responses to a multiple-choice instrument. Both MAMCR and MMA could only be applied to networks of incorrect responses. In this study, an extension of MMA is explored which allows the analysis of networks involving both correct and incorrect responses. The extension analyzes the network structure of the partial correlation matrix instead of the correlation matrix. The new algorithm, called MMA-P, was applied to the FCI and recovered much of the structure identified by MMA. The algorithm also identified sets of correct answers requiring similar physical reasoning reported in previous studies. Beyond groups of all correct and all incorrect responses, some groups of responses which mixed correct and incorrect responses were also identified. Some of these mixed response groups were produced when a correct response was selected for incorrect reasons; some of the groups were related to the gender unfair items previously reported for the FCI.},

When the results of MAMCR could not be replicated, a modification of the method was introduced, modified module analysis (MMA). MMA was productive in understanding the structure of the incorrect answers in the FCI, identifying 9 groups of incorrect answers on the pretest and 11 groups on the post-test. These groups, in most cases, could be mapped on to common misconceptions used by the authors of the FCI to create distractors for the instrument. Of these incorrect answer groups, 6 of the pretest groups and 8 of the post-test groups were the same for men and women. Two of the male-only pretest groups disappeared with instruction while the third male-only pretest group was identified for both men and women postinstruction. Three of the groups identified for both men and women on the post-test were not present for either on the pretest. The rest of the identified incorrect answer groups did not represent misconceptions, but were rather related to the blocked structure of some FCI items where multiple items are related to a common stem. The groups identified had little relation to the gender unfair items previously identified for this dataset, and therefore, differences in the structure of student misconceptions between men and women cannot explain the gender differences reported for the FCI.},

	title = {Learning and {Awareness}},
	abstract = {This book stems from more than 25 years of systematic research into the experience of learning undertaken by a research team trying to account for the obvious differences between more or less successful instances of learning in educational institutions. The book offers an answer in terms of the discovery of critical differences in the structure of the learner's awareness and critical differences in the meaning of the learner's world. The authors offer a detailed account of the empirical findings that give rise to theoretical insights, and discuss the particular form of qualitative research that has been employed and developed.

The form of learning that is the object of study is considered to be the most fundamental form -- namely a change in the learner's way of seeing, experiencing, handling, and understanding aspects of the world. The need for rigorous analysis of learning of specific subject matter, the individual construction of knowledge, and its social and cultural embeddedness -- the defining features of rival approaches into research on learning -- are reconciled from the approach adopted here into an intertwined and whole experience of learning. The learner's experience is always one of learning something, in some way, and in some context; by holding the learner's experience of learning as the focus of study throughout -- and not studying the learning of the content and the acts and the context as separate and distinct focuses -- the content, the act, and the context remain united as constituents of the learner's experience.

By empirically revealing critical differences in the ways of experiencing these aspects of learning, and by developing a theoretical framework for the dynamics through which change comes about in the learner's awareness, this book gradually leads the reader to a powerful new view of learning. Equipped with the analytical tools and conceptual apparatus to be found in this book, the reader will be empowered to learn and to assist others to learn by creating environments conducive to the most fundamental form of learning: experiencing aspects of the world in new ways.},

Two studies that have explored the experience of variation in university contexts – one from chemical engineering (distillation), and one from introductory physics (Newton's third law) – are summarised to illustrate the nature of the compelling results attained in these contexts, and a third study (of students learning the Bohr model of the atom) is taken up to better illustrate the nature of learning with variation.

We conducted a two-year quantitative and qualitative study of students’ use of free-body diagrams while solving physics problems. We found that when students are in a course that consistently emphasizes the use of free-body diagrams, the majority of them do use diagrams on their own to help solve exam problems even when they receive no credit for drawing the diagrams. We also found that students who draw diagrams correctly are significantly more successful in obtaining the right answer for the problem. Lastly, we interviewed students to uncover their reasons for using free-body diagrams. We found that high achieving students used the diagrams to help solve the problems and as a tool to evaluate their work while low achieving students only used representations as aids in the problem-solving process.},

	abstract = {Student understanding of the real images produced by converging lenses and concave mirrors was investigated both before and after instruction in geometrical optics. The primary data were gathered through interviews in which undergraduates taking introductory physics were asked to perform a set of prescribed tasks based on a simple demonstration. The criterion used to assess understanding was the ability to apply appropriate concepts and principles, including ray diagrams, to predict and explain image formation by an actual lens or mirror. Performance on the tasks, especially by students who had not had college instruction in geometrical optics, suggested the presence of certain naive conceptions. Students who had just completed the study of geometrical optics in their physics courses were frequently unable to relate the concepts, principles, and ray‐tracing techniques that had been taught in class to an actual physical system consisting of an object, a lens or a mirror, and a screen. Many students did not seem to understand the function of the lens, mirror, or screen, nor the uniqueness of the relationship among the components of the optical system. Difficulties in drawing and interpreting ray diagrams indicated inadequate understanding of the concept of a light ray and its graphical representation.},

	abstract = {At a number of U.S. universities, some physicists are focusing their research effort on physics education research (PER). This paper examines this development in terms of the knowledge of teaching and learning, curriculum projects and practices it has produced. First, a selective review of research and curriculum development projects provides an introduction to PER for readers unfamiliar with it. Studies based on surveys and interviews are emphasized, as well as curriculum projects that make use of microcomputer-based laboratory tools (MBL). Other efforts are mentioned more briefly, but illustrate the breath of research and development activity. Following the review, I examine the evidence for the effectiveness of some of the curricula discussed, and identify three areas in which greater interaction between the PER and educational researchers working in other fields should be fostered: (a) statistical data analysis, (b) micro-analysis of learning situations, and (c) ways in which subject matter knowledge in physics can contribute to school-based projects and educational research. The concluding section of the paper argues for multi-disciplinary graduate programs in physics education, which are intended to provide a solid base in physics as well as research and innovation in education.

	abstract = {This thesis examines meaning-making in three different areas of undergraduate physics: the refraction of light; electric circuits; and, electric potential and electric potential energy. In order to do this, a social semiotic perspective was constituted for the thesis to facilitate the analysis of meaning-making in terms of the semiotic resources that are typically used in the teaching and learning of physics. These semiotic resources include, for example, spoken and written language, diagrams, graphs, mathematical equations, gestures, simulations, laboratory equipment and working practices.

The empirical context of the thesis is introductory undergraduate physics where interactive engagement was part of the educational setting. This setting presents a rich data source, which is made up of video- and audio recordings and field notes for examining how semiotic resources affect physics teaching and learning.

Theory building is an integral part of the analysis in the thesis, which led to the constitution of a new analytical tool – patterns of disciplinary-relevant aspects. Part of this process then resulted in the development of a new construct, disciplinary affordance, which for a discipline such as physics, refers to the inherent potential of a semiotic resource to provide access to disciplinary knowledge. These two aspects, in turn, led to an exploration of new empirical and theoretical links to the Variation Theory of Learning.

The implications of this work for the teaching and learning of physics means that new focus is brought to the physics content (object of learning), the semiotic resources that are used to deal with that content, and how the semiotic resources are used to create patterns of variation within and across the disciplinary-relevant aspects. As such, the thesis provides physics teachers with new and powerful ways to analyze the semiotic resources that get used in efforts to optimize the teaching and learning of physics.},

Multimodality: A Social Semiotic Approach to Contemporary Communication represents a long-awaited and much anticipated addition to the study of multimodality from the scholar who pioneered and continues to play a decisive role in shaping the field. Written in an accessible manner and illustrated with a wealth of photos and illustrations to clearly demonstrate the points made, Multimodality: A Social Semiotic Approach to Contemporary Communication deliberately sets out to locate communication in the everyday, covering topics and issues not usually discussed in books of this kind, from traffic signs to mobile phones.

In this book, Gunther Kress presents a contemporary, distinctive and widely applicable approach to communication. He provides the framework necessary for understanding the attempt to bring all modes of meaning-making together under one unified theoretical roof.

This exploration of an increasingly vital area of language and communication studies will be of interest to advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students in the fields of English language and applied linguistics, media and communication studies and education.},

In another process, action sequences are based on kinesthetic schemata that themselves find their metaphoric expression in language. Again, gestures enact kinesthetic schemata that are correlated with verbal expressions.

The interplay of students’ playful exploration through physical engagement with the simulation environment, their attention to physics concepts and laws, and knowledge about the real planets orbiting the Sun presents an analytical challenge for the researcher and instructor encountering such complex learning environments. We argue that the framework of conceptual blending is particularly apt for dealing with the learning environment at hand, because it allows us to take into account the many diverse mental inputs that seem to shape the student activities described in the paper. We show how conceptual blending can be brought together with theoretical ideas concerned with embodied cognition and epistemology of physics, in order to provide researchers and instructors with a powerful lens for looking critically at immersive technology-supported learning environments.},

Chronotopes have been defined in terms of socially emergent configurations of space-time, where space and time are considered as interdependent social constructions. Chronotope is seen as a conceptual and analytical tool that allows reaching a sociocultural and dialogical understanding of human action and interaction in space-time. We argue that the existing chronotopic research has not been sufficiently explicit concerning how units of analysis are selected and conceptualized. To facilitate a wider adoption of this concept, we introduce and discuss four dimensions of chronotopic units of analysis (foregrounding processes, dialogicality, material-discursive features of space-time, and interdependency of space-time). We illustrate these dimensions by discussing how they were implicitly or explicitly included in the conceptualization of the unit of analysis in exemplary studies. In particular, we show how including one or more of these dimensions enabled to make “visible” educationally relevant phenomena and to discuss significant aspects of pedagogical practice. In all, our article contributes to make explicit and discuss the methodological foundations for using chronotope to research the space-time relations of learning.},

School classrooms are highly cluttered audiovisual scenes containing many overlapping faces and voices. Due to the difficulty of labeling them (reliable coding requires weeks of training) and their sensitive nature (students and teachers may be in stressful or potentially embarrassing situations), CLASS- labeled classroom video datasets are scarce, and their labels are sparse (just a few labels per 15-minute video dip). Thus, the overarching challenge was how to harness modern deep perceptual architectures despite the paucity of labeled data. Through training low-level CNN-based facial attribute detectors (facial expression \& adult/child) as well as a direct audio-to- climate regressor, and by integrating low-level information over time using a Bi-LSTM, we constructed automated detectors of positive and negative classroom climate with accuracy (10- fold cross-validation Pearson correlation on 241 CLASS-labeled videos) of 0.40 and 0.51, respectively. These numbers are superior to what we obtained using shallower architectures. This work represents the first automated system designed to detect specific dimensions of the CLASS.},

In doing this, we briefly review the paradigm “wars” and incompatibility thesis, we show some commonalities between quantitative and qualitative research, we explain the tenets of pragmatism, we explain the fundamental principle of mixed research and how to apply it, we provide specific sets of designs for the two major types of mixed methods research ( mixed-model designs and mixed-method designs), and, finally, we explain mixed methods research as following (recursively) an eight-step process. A key feature of mixed methods research is its methodological pluralism or eclecticism, which frequently results in superior research (compared to monomethod research). Mixed methods research will be successful as more investigators study and help advance its concepts and as they regularly practice it.},

The traditional social sciences, such as sociology or anthropology, are thus under the threat of becoming marginalized or even irrelevant because of the prevalence of the new methods of research, which require more computational skills. This chapter describes a way for researchers to enter this new domain and keep their advantage of mastering qualitative research relevant: a new, mixed-method of Thick Big Data, relying on a combination of quantitative approaches (data scraping, Social Network Analysis, culturomics, sentiment analysis) with qualitative ones (digital ethnography, narrative analysis, cultural studies). The chapter outlines how these approaches may blend, and offers some practical advice for a researcher without coding skills on how to take the first steps in online research, through examples focused on Wikipedia.},

Various backbone extraction algorithms have been proposed in different scientific fields. Although of clear interest to transport geographers, backbone extraction techniques have been adopted unevenly and in an ad hoc fashion in transport geography research. In this paper we therefore present a conceptual and experimental comparison of backbone extraction techniques in a transport-geographical context, and explore the new insights each technique can offer to enhance our understanding of the Southeast Asian intercity air transport network (SAAN). We review six frequently-used methods, i.e. global weight thresholding method (GWTM), k-core decomposition method (KCDM), minimum spanning tree method (MSTM), primary linkage analysis method (PLAM), multiple linkage analysis method (MLAM), and the disparity filter algorithm method (DFAM), and elaborate their analytical essence by applying them to extract the backbone of the SAAN. The abstracted networks are compared in terms of their geographical and topological structures using the initial network as a benchmark. This comparison is then used to point out the different techniques' potential in light of different transport geography research applications.},

To realize these gains, students must all contribute. Strategies like assigning roles, group contracts, anonymous peer evaluations, and peer ratings all encourage student participation. In a class using these strategies, we conducted in-depth interviews to uncover student perceptions of group work in general and the utility of these support strategies. Students in both high- and low-performance groups still complained of unequal contributions while praising the social support provided by groups. Students who scored highly on tests were more likely to recognize the benefits of group work, regardless of their groups’ overall performance levels, while lower-scoring students perceived group work as time-consuming “busy work” with little cognitive benefit. Comments from anonymous peer evaluations differed only subtly between high- and low-performance groups. Numerical ratings on these evaluations did correlate with overall group performance. However, students in lower-performance groups assigned harsh ratings to their low-scoring members, while students in higher-performance groups were more generous in their ratings for low-scoring members. We discuss implications of relying on support strategies for promoting productive group work.},

	abstract = {Although much is known about the difference between expert and novice problem solvers, knowledge of those differences typically does not provide enough detail to help instructors understand why some students seem to learn while solving problems and others do not. A critical issue appears to be how students use the knowledge they have in the context of solving a particular problem. In this paper we outline a theoretical cognitive model for making sense of how students use mathematics in the context of physics problems. The model is developed within the theoretical framework of resources. We identify four classes of fundamental mathematical resources and six organizational structures or epistemic games. Each game is a locally coherent associational pattern of control structures (expectations) activating resources and processes (moves) within the specific example. The hypothesis that students tend to function within the narrow confines of a fairly limited set of games provides a good description of most of our data. We demonstrate the use of these resources and games in examples taken from videoclips of students solving problems in a two-semester reformed algebra-based physics course at the University of Maryland. Implications for instruction are discussed.},

Although decades of research have focused on the advantages and disadvantages of concrete and abstract materials considered independently, we argue for an approach that moves beyond this dichotomy and combines their advantages. Specifically, we recommend beginning with concrete materials and then explicitly and gradually fading to the more abstract. Theoretical benefits of this “concreteness fading” technique for mathematics and science instruction include (1) helping learners interpret ambiguous or opaque abstract symbols in terms of well-understood concrete objects, (2) providing embodied perceptual and physical experiences that can ground abstract thinking, (3) enabling learners to build up a store of memorable images that can be used when abstract symbols lose meaning, and (4) guiding learners to strip away extraneous concrete properties and distill the generic, generalizable properties. In these ways, concreteness fading provides advantages that go beyond the sum of the benefits of concrete and abstract materials.},

	abstract = {The usage of psychological networks that conceptualize behavior as a complex interplay of psychological and other components has gained increasing popularity in various research fields. While prior publications have tackled the topics of estimating and interpreting such networks, little work has been conducted to check how accurate (i.e., prone to sampling variation) networks are estimated, and how stable (i.e., interpretation remains similar with less observations) inferences from the network structure (such as centrality indices) are. In this tutorial paper, we aim to introduce the reader to this field and tackle the problem of accuracy under sampling variation. We first introduce the current state-of-the-art of network estimation. Second, we provide a rationale why researchers should investigate the accuracy of psychological networks. Third, we describe how bootstrap routines can be used to (A) assess the accuracy of estimated network connections, (B) investigate the stability of centrality indices, and (C) test whether network connections and centrality estimates for different variables differ from each other. We introduce two novel statistical methods: for (B) the correlation stability coefficient, and for (C) the bootstrapped difference test for edge-weights and centrality indices. We conducted and present simulation studies to assess the performance of both methods. Finally, we developed the free R-package bootnet that allows for estimating psychological networks in a generalized framework in addition to the proposed bootstrap methods. We showcase bootnet in a tutorial, accompanied by R syntax, in which we analyze a dataset of 359 women with posttraumatic stress disorder available online.},

The two outcomes of interest were assessed with a performance task that required small groups of students to explain a discrepant event and then generate a scientific argument. Student performance on this task was compared before and after an 18-week intervention that included 15 ADI laboratory activities. The results of this study suggest that the students had better disciplinary engagement and produced better arguments after the intervention although some learning issues arose that seemed to hinder the students' overall improvement.

	abstract = {Network science provides effective tools to model and analyze complex systems. However, the increasing size of real-world networks becomes a major hurdle in order to understand their structure and topological features. Therefore, mapping the original network into a smaller one while preserving its information is an important issue. Extracting the so-called backbone of a network is a very challenging problem that is generally handled either by coarse-graining or filter-based methods. Coarse-graining methods reduce the network size by grouping similar nodes, while filter-based methods prune the network by discarding nodes or edges based on a statistical property. In this paper, we propose and investigate two filter-based methods exploiting the overlapping community structure in order to extract the backbone in weighted networks. Indeed, highly connected nodes (hubs) and overlapping nodes are at the heart of the network. In the first method, called “overlapping nodes ego backbone”, the backbone is formed simply from the set of overlapping nodes and their neighbors. In the second method, called “overlapping nodes and hubs backbone”, the backbone is formed from the set of overlapping nodes and the hubs. For both methods, the links with the lowest weights are removed from the network as long as a backbone with a single connected component is preserved. Experiments have been performed on real-world weighted networks originating from various domains (social, co-appearance, collaboration, biological, and technological) and different sizes. Results show that both backbone extraction methods are quite similar. Furthermore, comparison with the most influential alternative filtering method demonstrates the greater ability of the proposed backbones extraction methods to uncover the most relevant parts of the network.},

Differing from previous content reviews, this study proposes a series of quantitative computer-based analyses by integrating document co-citation analysis, social network analysis, and exploratory factor analysis to explore the intellectual structure of the MSiSE literature (i.e. the relationships within and between subfields of MSiSE). Co-citation refers to any two articles that are jointly referenced in other articles. After the computation of co-citation analysis, 27 articles that have been co-cited at least once by follow-up studies as references were identified as the final set of core articles. The whole co-citation profile of 27 cores with the 434 links was then visualized in a network through social network analysis, representing an overview for the intellectual structure of core MSiSE studies. The most cross-referenced underpinnings in the network focused on adaptive scaffolding for self-regulated learning to enhance students’ conceptual understanding and on younger students’ metacognition in online science inquiry learning environments. Furthermore, two emerging topics in the network were identified through an exploratory factor analysis as “non-technological metacognitive scaffolding media,” and “behavior patterns \& task analysis in technology-infused environments.” Overall, the study provides an innovative review method of scholarly communication in the MSiSE literature.},

The data sets are based on all research papers published in four of the top journals in statistics from \$2003\$ to the first half of \$2012\$. We analyze the data sets from many different perspectives, focusing on (a) centrality, (b) community structures, and (c) productivity, patterns and trends. For (a), we have identified the most prolific/collaborative/highly cited authors. We have also identified a handful of "hot" papers, suggesting "Variable Selection" as one of the "hot" areas. For (b), we have identified about \$15\$ meaningful communities or research groups, including large-size ones such as "Spatial Statistics", "Large-Scale Multiple Testing", "Variable Selection" as well as small-size ones such as "Dimensional Reduction", "Objective Bayes", "Quantile Regression", and "Theoretical Machine Learning". For (c), we find that over the 10-year period, both the average number of papers per author and the fraction of self citations have been decreasing, but the proportion of distant citations has been increasing. These suggest that the statistics community has become increasingly more collaborative, competitive, and globalized. Our findings shed light on research habits, trends, and topological patterns of statisticians. The data sets provide a fertile ground for future researches on or related to social networks of statisticians.},

Differing from previous content reviews, this study proposes a series of quantitative computer-based analyses by integrating document co-citation analysis, social network analysis, and exploratory factor analysis to explore the intellectual structure of the MSiSE literature (i.e. the relationships within and between subfields of MSiSE). Co-citation refers to any two articles that are jointly referenced in other articles. After the computation of co-citation analysis, 27 articles that have been co-cited at least once by follow-up studies as references were identified as the final set of core articles. The whole co-citation profile of 27 cores with the 434 links was then visualized in a network through social network analysis, representing an overview for the intellectual structure of core MSiSE studies. The most cross-referenced underpinnings in the network focused on adaptive scaffolding for self-regulated learning to enhance students’ conceptual understanding and on younger students’ metacognition in online science inquiry learning environments. Furthermore, two emerging topics in the network were identified through an exploratory factor analysis as “non-technological metacognitive scaffolding media,” and “behavior patterns \& task analysis in technology-infused environments.” Overall, the study provides an innovative review method of scholarly communication in the MSiSE literature.},

In educational research, such information includes different positions within a field; for example, theoretical positions underpinning empirical studies. Such theoretical positions may influence interpretations of research results and remain a challenge to map and present. Here, we show how to use thematic analysis and network analysis to construct maps, analyse and synthesize theoretical positions within educational research. We use early childhood inquiry-based science education (ECIBSE) literature as a case because of its historical roots in Dewey’s educational philosophy. This allows us to discuss findings in light of a well-known theoretical framework. Using our methodology, we analyse four theoretical positions for teaching and learning: (1) science should be learned through inquiry, (2) teaching should model scientific practices, (3) children should develop science-related competencies (4) child’s experience should take precedence. After discussing these positions, we turn to methodological possibilities and challenges of using thematic network analysis for literature reviews.

Using administrative register data covering all children born in 1994–1995 in Denmark, I examine whether the high-aspiring educational choices of children of immigrants convert into educational success or, conversely, into low grades and increased dropout rates. I find that, compared with children of Danish origin, children of immigrants are not only more likely to enrol in academic upper secondary education but also make more ambitious track and subject choices at this educational level. These ethnic choice effects are particularly pronounced at low levels of academic performance. Applying a counterfactual re-weighting approach, I show that, although ethnic choice effects reduce the ethnic gap in overall attainment of academic upper secondary education, they also widen ethnic gaps in dropout rates and achievement. My findings indicate that high aspirations among ethnic minorities operate as a double-edged sword as they help close the educational gap between them and their native-origin peers but at the cost of inducing academically weaker students to embark on less feasible educational trajectories.},

The dataset includes 849 participants over five-time points from 2010 to 2015. Findings show that over time individual’s anti-immigrant attitudes increased in classrooms with a higher average level of anti-immigrant sentiment net of the effect of classroom heterogeneity. However, this finding was true only while students were still enrolled in the same class over the first three waves of the study. After students entered high school, the classroom/time interaction effect disappears, suggesting that other contextual influences take over.

Researchers introduced an index to control for class differences in the relative number of ethnic minority and majority children and analyzed both child as chooser and child as chosen dynamics. They found that minority/majority status was associated with in-group preference, social preference, and social status, disadvantaging minority children, especially in the smaller city. Salience was associated with minority status only. In-group preference did not correlate with out-group bias. Findings revealed potential risks and protective factors for minority children. Evidence contradicted stereotypic characterizations of minority children.},

	abstract = {As a natural abstraction of a large number of real-world systems, the structure and function of complex networks have been attracting increasing attentions in recent years. Existing studies have highlighted the statistical heterogeneity of connection patterns in large-scale networks, where valuable information is usually overwhelmed by redundant intricacy. In this case, the extraction of truly relevant nodes/connections of a large-scale network, namely, network backbones, can help form reduced but meaningful representations of a large-scale complex network and understand its fundamental structure and function. However, so far as we know, most existing backbone extraction methods focus mainly on the extraction of structural backbones, such as centrality-based backbones. Few studies have studied the problem of how to extract the functional backbones of a network, which is relevant to certain functional properties of the network. Accordingly, in this paper, we present two motif-based extraction methods to extract functional backbones of complex networks based on higher-order organization of salient motifs. One is built upon the global threshold method, and the other is based on the disparity filter method. We implement our proposed methods on a set of real-world networks to evaluate the performance. The results show that our extraction methods are more effective than other existing methods in terms of extracting functional backbones of a network, measured by motif centrality, motif degree, and motif abundance.},

We prove that the resulting optimization problem is \$\${\textbackslash}mathbf\{NP\}\$\$-hard. We show that a standard greedy algorithm performs very well in practice, even though it does not have theoretical guarantees. Additionally, if the activity traces have a tree structure, we show that the objective function is supermodular, and experimentally verify that the approach for size-constrained submodular minimization recently proposed by Nagano et al. (28th International Conference on Machine Learning, 2011) produces very good results.

Our analysis identified a continuous interest within the USA, where EDS originated, and increasing adoption in Asian and European countries, with usage across primary, secondary, and higher education levels. It was used as stand-alone pedagogy or in combination with other pedagogies, usually in the humanities and social science contexts. The review categorizes five orientations (appropriative, agentive, reflective, reconstructive, and reflexive) and eight types of outcomes (affective, cognitive, conceptual, academic, technological, linguistic, ontological, and social). Based on this synthesis, we discuss three issues: a linguistic conundrum, a rosy picture of positive outcomes, and a further expansion of the optimal reconstructive orientation. Possible reasons for these issues are explored, and directions for future studies are suggested.},

GBSs were used during practice and the development in students’ weekly products was examined. This study was designed on the basis of mixed methodology. The quasi-experimental part includes experimental and control groups. The groups received the same lecture by the same lecturer, but in the laboratory sessions the practicing approach was designed separately. The experimental group received GBS integrated tasks. The scenario flow of each week occurred through an existing character. The students completed 10 products during one semester. The scores of students’ weekly products, observation notes of the researchers, pre and post-test scores, and interview data were analyzed and used in a complimentary manner. The analyses showed that GBS integration significantly affected the knowledge and skill improvement in block-based programming. The knowncontributions of block-based tools were also observed, but the realistic nature of GBSs contributed the programming instruction in the affective dimension. They served as tools for motivation, scaffolding, and monitoring.},

	abstract = {Based on a sociocultural perspective, this study explores the outcome of using a model that combines storytelling and drama to teach young children science. The research question is: How is children’s learning aﬀected when using a combination of storytelling and drama to explain a complex scientiﬁc concept?. Two preschools and one primary school were visited. Altogether 25 children aged 4–8 years participated. Each group listened to a story about The Rhinovirus Rita. No pictures were shown during storytelling. After the story was told, a play was performed with the children, telling the same story they just had listened to, and the children also made drawings. At a second visit to the schools, each child was interviewed individually and their drawings were used to stimulate recall. The results show that many of the children had learnt the names of immune system cells and how they work when someone has a cold. Moreover, they had also learnt that viruses cause colds. There were also a small number of children who did not show any learning development related to this speciﬁc content. Still, we argue that the combination of storytelling and drama is an instructional strategy that has positive potential when it comes to teaching children science.},

	abstract = {The vision of the Framework and NGSS requires important shifts in teach­ ing approaches and instructional materials. We argue that this commit­ ment to engaging learners in meaningful practice and supporting students’ epistemic agency entails that we support coherence from the students’ perspective. This coherence arises when students see their science work as making progress on questions and problems their classroom community has committed to address, rather than simply following direc­ tions from textbooks or teachers. We present an instructional model, storylines, to support this form of coherence. The storylines approach includes design principles for engaging students with phenomena and problems to elicit their own questions that teachers, with support of curriculum materials, use to guide the trajectory of their sensemaking. We describe how storylines organize cycles of engaging with phenomena, questions, and sensemaking to incrementally build, test, and revise expla­ natory models and design solutions. Storylines are supported by a collection of instructional routines and norms that provide strategies and tools to guide teachers’ work with students around phenomena, questions, and sensemaking. The routines reflect strategies for eliciting questions from anchoring phenomena, navigation to engage students as partners in managing the direction of investigations, problematizing to help students find gaps in their work so far, and putting pieces together to support students in assembling what they have figured out. We present examples from elementary, middle, and high school storyline-based units awarded the NGSS design badge to illustrate the application of these design principles in the design and enactment of storyline-based units.},

To better understand active learning, we constructed this review through an innovative interdisciplinary collaboration involving research teams from psychology and discipline-based education research (DBER). Our collaboration examined active learning from two different perspectives (i.e., psychology and DBER) and surveyed the current landscape of undergraduate STEM instructional practices related to the modes of active learning and traditional lecture. On that basis, we concluded that active learning—which is commonly used to communicate an alternative to lecture and does serve a purpose in higher education classroom practice—is an umbrella term that is not particularly useful in advancing research on learning. To clarify, we synthesized a working definition of active learning that operates within an elaborative framework, which we call the construction-of-understanding ecosystem. A cornerstone of this framework is that undergraduate learners should be active agents during instruction and that the social construction of meaning plays an important role for many learners, above and beyond their individual cognitive construction of knowledge. Our proposed framework offers a coherent and actionable concept of active learning with the aim of advancing future research and practice in undergraduate STEM education.},

	abstract = {Vocational students and beginning professionals typically find it hard to integrate the mathematics and statistics that they have learned at school with work-related knowledge. To explore how such an integration process could be supported, we conducted an intervention in secondary vocational laboratory education. Our boundary-crossing approach was informed by the literature on boundary crossing and accompanying learning mechanisms (e.g., reflection in the form of perspective making and taking, and transformation in the form of hybridization). We hypothesized that reflection, as making and taking perspectives on school-taught and work-related knowledge, could lead to transformation, i.e., help students integrate these types of knowledge into a hybridized whole. Data collection included video and audio recordings of five 1-h meetings with three students, the data from their research projects, and interviews with the teacher and two workplace supervisors. The analysis of the students’ reasoning during the meetings revealed that their level of integrating school-taught statistics and work-related knowledge increased significantly and with a medium effect size. This suggests that a boundary-crossing approach can support students in integrating school-taught and work-related knowledge.},

The review of the literature reveals four potential learning mechanisms that can take place at boundaries: identifica- tion, coordination, reflection, and transformation.

Methods: Following scoping searches, an examination was made of the vocabulary associated with the literature of review and synthesis (literary warrant). A simple analytical framework - Search, AppraisaL, Synthesis and Analysis (SALSA) - was used to examine the main review types. Results: Fourteen review types and associated methodologies were analysed against the SALSA framework, illustrating the inputs and processes of each review type. A description of the key characteristics is given, together with perceived strengths and weaknesses. A limited number of review types are currently utilized within the health information domain. Conclusions: Few review types possess prescribed and explicit methodologies and many fall short of being mutually exclusive. Notwithstanding such limitations, this typology provides a valuable reference point for those commissioning, conducting, supporting or interpreting reviews, both within health information and the wider health care domain. © 2009 Health Libraries Group.},

Our research question was: Which teaching strategies are used by K-12 teachers when promoting inquiry-based education in their classrooms and what are the reported outcomes? After searching for empirical studies on this topic, we examined 186 studies investigating different ways in which teachers can promote inquiry-based education. Analyses revealed varying teaching strategies, differing with regard to direction (teacher directed, student directed and mixed) and different perspectives of regulation (meta-cognitive, conceptual, and social regulation). Results show that important teacher strategies in metacognitive regulation are: focussing on thinking skills, developing a culture of inquiry, supporting inquiry discourse, and promoting nature of science; in conceptual regulation: providing information on the research topic and focussing on conceptual understanding; and in social regulation: bridging the gap between high and low achievers, organizing student learning in groups and focussing on collaboration processes.},

Social Network Analysis (SNA) can make the interpretation of large collections of literature more manageable. This paper provides a method for generating a co-authorship network from reference lists. The partition of the co-authorship network into communities provides a reviewer with direction to organise literature into meaningful groups. The interpretation of seemingly disparate and entangled research programs is far more manageable when interpreting smaller collections of highly relevant literature.},

	abstract = {Both meta-analysis and traditional literature or narrative reviews strive to compile a great deal of information in an accessible and succinct manner. In recent years, social work researchers have been turning toward meta-analysis to identify issues in large areas of research. In order for meta-analysis to be a rigorous and objective source of information there are a certain set of assumptions that must be met about how to carry out the process of including and excluding various studies. However, when these assumptions are not met, the information provided can be misleading. Traditional literature reviews continue to offer a valid and important way to identify existing patterns and gaps in social work research. In fact, because they draw not only on quantitative (as does meta-analysis) but also qualitative studies their reach may often be broader. This paper examines the strengths, weaknesses and utility of both practices in social work research today. © Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

We analyse two types of networks: social networks, that is, co-authorship networks, and cognitive mapping or the network of disciplines affected by AHP. Our analyses are based on 8441 papers published between 1979 and 2017, retrieved from the ISI Web of Science database. To provide a longitudinal perspective on the pattern of evolution of AHP, we analyse these two types of networks during the three periods 1979–1990, 1991–2001 and 2002–2017. We provide some basic statistics on AHP journals and researchers, review the main topics and applications of integrated AHPs and provide direction for future research by highlighting some open questions.},

Our research group analyzes large sets of student responses by developing computer models that are trained using human-coded responses and a suite of machine-learning techniques. Once a model is initially trained, it may be insufficiently accurate. Increasing the number of human-coded responses typically enhances these models to an acceptable level of accuracy. Alternatively, instead of human coding responses, we can rapidly increase the number of coded responses by verifying computer-predicted codes for each response. However, having access to this information may bias human coders. We designed the present study to test for differences in level of agreement with computer-predicted codes in terms of magnitude and direction during computer model calibration if information about computer-predicted codes is available. Our results indicate human coding bias despite being disciplinary experts who were aware of the possibility of cognitive bias creating statistical bias and that magnitude and direction of that bias varies across experts.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the education system worldwide that was responding with a sudden shift to distance learning. Various physics courses such as lectures, tutorials, and the laboratories had to be transferred into online formats rapidly, resulting in a variety of simultaneous, asynchronous, and mixed activities. To investigate how physics students perceived the sudden shift to online learning, we developed a questionnaire and gathered data from N = 578 physics students from five universities in Germany, Austria, and Croatia. In this article, we report how the problem-solving sessions (recitations) and laboratories were adapted, how students' judge different formats of the courses and how useful and effective they perceive them. The results are correlated to the students' self-efficacy ratings and other behavioral measures (such as self-regulated learning skills) and demographics. In a related article, we focus on the online physics lectures and compare simultaneous vs. asynchronous teaching and learning methods (n.n.). We find that good communication abilities and self-organization skills are positively correlated for perceived learning achievement. Furthermore, the previous duration of studies had a significant impact on the students' perceived overall learning achievement, on the students' acquisition of experimental skills during the physics laboratories, and on their assessment of the recitations' effectiveness. That is, students in their first academic year show consistently lower scores than more progressed students. For the physics laboratories, it was found that gathering real data was crucial to the acquisition of experimental skills and the reinforcement of content. For the physics recitations, handing in own solutions for feedback was correlated with perceived effectiveness. We draw conclusions and implications for future online classes.},

	abstract = {What does it mean to understand a physics equation? The use of formal expressions in physics is not just a matter of the rigorous and routinized application of principles, followed by the formal manipulation of expressions to obtain an answer. Rather, successful students learn to understand what equations say in a fundamental sense; they have a feel for expressions, and this guides their work. More specifically, students learn to understand physics equations in terms of a vocabulary of elements that I call symbolic forms. Each symbolic form associates a simple conceptual schema with a pattern of symbols in an equation. This hypothesis has implications for how we should understand what must be taught and learned in physics classrooms. From the point of view of improving instruction, it is absolutely critical to acknowledge that physics expertise involves this more flexible and generative understanding of equations, and our instruction should be geared toward helping students to acquire this understanding. The work described here is based on an analysis of a corpus of videotapes in which university students solve physics problems.},

	abstract = {In recent years, researchers have become aware of the experiential grounding of scientific thought. Accordingly, research has shown that metaphorical mappings between experience-based source domains and abstract target domains are omnipresent in everyday and scientific language. The theory of conceptual metaphor explains these findings based on the assumption that understanding is embodied. Embodied understanding arises from recurrent bodily and social experience with our environment. As our perception is adapted to a medium-scale dimension, our embodied conceptions originate from this mesocosmic scale. With respect to this epistemological principle, we distinguish between micro-, meso- and macrocosmic phenomena. We use these insights to analyse how external representations of phenomena in the micro- and macrocosm can foster learning when they (a) address the students’ learning demand by affording a mesocosmic experience or (b) assist reflection on embodied conceptions by representing their image schematic structure. We base our considerations on empirical evidence from teaching experiments on phenomena from the microcosm (microbial growth and signal conduction in neurons) and the macrocosm (greenhouse effect and carbon cycle). We discuss how the theory of conceptual metaphor can inform the development of external representations.},

We used the cognitive linguistic framework of experientialism to shed new light on this valuable pool of studies to identify the conceptual resources of understanding climate change. In our study, we interviewed 35 secondary school students on their understanding of the greenhouse effect and analysed the conceptions of climate scientists as drawn from textbooks and research reports. We analysed all data by metaphor analysis and qualitative content analysis to gain insight into students' and scientists' resources for understanding. In our analysis, we found that students and scientists refer to the same schemata to understand the greenhouse effect. We categorised their conceptions into three different principles the conceptions are based on: warming by more input, warming by less output, and warming by a new equilibrium. By interrelating students' and scientists' conceptions, we identified the students' learning demand: First, our students were afforded with experiences regarding the interactions of electromagnetic radiation and CO2. Second, our students reflected about the experience-based schemata they use as source domains for metaphorical understanding of the greenhouse effect. By uncovering the-mostly unconscious-deployed schemata, we gave students access to their source domains. We implemented these teaching guidelines in interventions and evaluated them in teaching experiments to develop evidence-based and theory-guided learning activities on the greenhouse effect. © 2013 Taylor \& Francis.},

	abstract = {Many authors stress the importance of basing teaching on students' prior knowledge. To build a bridge between students' everyday knowledge and scientific concepts, the role of metaphors and analogies came into the focus of the science education community during the past two decades. Approaches using metaphor-based teaching strategies often regard metaphors and analogies as teaching tools that can be adopted by a teacher. On the basis of the theoretical framework of experientialism, we argue that not only teaching but also thinking about and understanding science without metaphors and analogies is not possible. An analysis of studies dealing with metaphors and analogies in science education shows that instructional analogies and metaphors are often not understood as intended or not used by students in their own explanations. By reanalyzing 199 instructional metaphors and analogies on the basis of a metaphor analysis, we show that it takes more than making a connection to everyday life to communicate science fruitfully. We show that good instructional metaphors and analogies need embodied sources. These embodied sources are everyday experiences conceptualized in, for example, schemata such as containers, paths, balances, and up and down. For the analysis, we introduce the concept of conceptual metaphors for analyzing metaphors as well as analogies. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We discuss the nature of image schemas and focus particularly on one: effort-resistance-flow. This schema is fundamental not only in our everyday experience, but also in most of school physics.

A complex pattern was observed in terms of which type of activity (writing, answering or commenting on questions) was most beneficial for students; however, there was some evidence that students of lower intermediate ability may have gained particular benefit. In all modules, a modest but statistically significant positive correlation was found between students' PeerWise activity and their examination performance, after taking prior ability into account. This suggests that engaging with the production and discussion of student-generated content in the form of MCQs can support student learning in a way that is not critically dependent on course, institution, instructor or student. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor \& Francis.},

This enzyme can be used as a first step in the utilization of CO2 as carbon substrate for production of high-in-demand chemicals. However, comparison and categorization of the very diverse group of FDH enzymes has received only limited attention. With specific emphasis on FDH catalyzed CO2 reduction to HCOO−, we present a novel classification scheme for FDHs based on protein sequence alignment and gene organization analysis. We show that prokaryotic FDHs can be neatly divided into six meaningful sub-types. These sub-types are discussed in the context of overall structural composition, phylogeny of the gene segment organization, metabolic role, and catalytic properties of the enzymes. Based on the available literature, the influence of electron donor choice on the efficacy of FDH catalyzed CO2 reduction is quantified and compared. This analysis shows that methyl viologen and hydrogen are several times more potent than NADH as electron donors. Hence, the new FDH classification scheme and the electron donor analysis provide an improved base for developing FDH-facilitated CO2 reduction as a viable step in the utilization of CO2 as carbon source for green production of chemicals.},

A synthesis of relevant studies and modelling done in the field shows that essential aspects affecting attrition and retention can be effectively conceptualized and acted upon in terms of the interplay between student and institution. These aspects were used in combination with James Gee's notion of Discourse models to design a unique framing for interpretation of interviews aimed at bringing out new causal dynamics that lie in this interplay. To illustrate this interpretation, Aristotle's notion of four causes is used. The analysis presented is a study of interviews with seven former physics students about their early departure. This framing of the analysis was necessary because the students' description of how they understood their actions did not explicitly reveal interplay between student and institution. These details lay behind a 'wall of introspection' that otherwise posed a serious challenge to the use of student testimony as direct means to identify and address issues of early departure.

It introduces some precise elements of this theory in which a teacher provides an environment for student work that aims to enable students, through constructive inquiry, to acquire well defined pieces of scientific knowledge. Situations become fundamental if they not only allow, but force students to construct the target knowledge. A classical example from mathematics is presented, where the target knowledge is a theorem of plane geometry presented as a puzzle. Then a new fundamental situation in biology is described for parthenogenetic reproduction, which has recently turned out to occur in Komodo dragons. An explicit demand to generate and test hypotheses that could explain the given example of dragon reproduction, using authentic DNA data, is given to students. The paper concludes with an analysis of the extent to which this fundamental situation in biology is authentic to the theory of didactical situations.},

Both of the questionnaires, which were modified from [Lin, Liang, \& Tsai (2015a) and Lin, Liang, \& Tsai (2015b)]’ instruments, had been translated into Indonesian language and validated through an exploratory factor analysis of participants’ responses. The differences between student levels were explored for their significance using an ANOVA test in order to portray a clear line among different conceptions of learning physics and physics learning self-efficacy. The results indicated that, first, the instruments used in the research had satisfactory validity and reliability. Second, students in sophomore level were significantly lower on the conceptions of testing than those in other levels. Meanwhile, the conceptions of calculating-practicing and understanding were not significantly different. Third, university students in senior level performed more confident in four dimensions: science content, higher-order thinking, everyday application, and science communication than others.

	abstract = {Copyright © 2017, arXiv, All rights reserved. In 2004 Denmark introduced a compulsory integrated science course the most popular upper secondary study program. One of the nation-wide course aims are for students to "achieve knowledge about some of the central scientific issues and their social, ethical, and historical perspectives". This is to be done via collaboration between the subjects, and often involves physics and another scientific subject. The official teaching plans further state that mathematics must be used for analysing data. We use network analysis to study six different implementations of the course in terms of the structure of different kinds of teaching/learning activities. By creating networks maps of each lesson, we show that teaching/learning activities in the course seldom tends to address how sciences can work together to solve a problem, but rather stages each natural science as a distinct and separate activity with a distinct identity.},

Problem solving in physics and mathematics have been characterized in terms of five phases by Schonfeld and these have previously been used to describe also online and blended behavior. We argue that expanding the use of server logs to make detailed categorizations of student actions can help increase knowledge about how students solve problems. We present a novel approach for analyzing server logs that relies on network analysis and principal component analysis. We use the approach to analyze student interactions with an online textbook that features physics problems. We find five 'components of behavioral structure': Complexity, Linear Length, Navigation, Mutuality, and Erraticism. Further, we find that problem solving sessions can be divided into three over-arching groups that differ in their Complexity and further into ten clusters that also differ on the other components. Analyzing typical sessions in each cluster, we find ten different behavioral structures, which we describe in terms of Schonfeld's phases. We suggest that further research integrates this approach with other methodological approaches to get a fuller picture of how learning strategies are employed by students in settings with online features.},

	abstract = {This study was designed to find out why students may fail to learn from teacher demonstrations. In the context of an interpretive study in an Australian senior‐year physics course, data were collected to understand the constraints that mediated learning about rotational motion. Over a period of 6 weeks, we gathered observational data, videotapes of classroom transactions, interviews with students and the teacher, and students' notebooks. Our analysis revealed six dimensions that may have prevented students from learning what the teacher had intended. These dimensions included (a) students' lack of theoretical framework to separate signals—the phenomena—from noise, (b) interference of discourses learned in other contexts of the physics course, (c) interference from other demonstrations and images that had some surface resemblance, (d) students' problems in piecing together coherent representational frameworks from the information given, (e) low salience of knowledge related to demonstrations on tests, and (f) lack of opportunities for students to test their descriptions and explanations. A set of recommendations is presented designed to facilitate teachers in changing their perspective on demonstrations and their associated practices for improving student learning. The recommendations are embedded in a framework that allows teacher reflection and action research. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 34: 509–533, 1997.},

	abstract = {Testing – classroom based as well as large-scale testing for comparative purposes – is becoming an increasingly important factor in educational policy in Denmark as in the other Nordic countries. Test results are attracting headlines in the media, often because these results disturb the national self-image of being among the best in the world, and improvement in these tests is established as a political goal. Especially high-stakes and large-scale tests affect both the national educational policy and the teaching in the classroom – not necessarily directly, but increasingly indirectly through the values and the discourse they impose on the school and society. These effects will be illustrated through the results from two larger research projects in which the author participated. The first is a Danish Clearinghouse study on the pedagogical consequences of high-stakes tests, showing the negative influence of these tests on teaching and on student behaviour. The other is a research project validating the PISA test in a Danish context, showing how the PISA tests, as an example of large-scale, comparative tests, have become a lever for dramatic changes in the Danish educational policy, without building on a valid justification. On a general level, these examples are seen as confirming the overall shift driven by global test systems, from a ‘bildung/didaktik’ approach (traditionally undertaken in the Nordic/Central European countries) towards a curriculum/policy driven approach (Anglo-American tradition) within education. Finally, the article will draw from the demonstrated tendencies to present some leadership and policy implications.},

In this article, we introduce LCA in order to demonstrate its usefulness to early adolescence researchers. We provide an application of LCA to empirical data collected from a national survey carried out in 2010 in Italy to assess mathematics and reading skills of fifth-grade primary school pupils (10 years in age). The data were used to measure pupils? supplies of cultural capital by specifying a latent class model. This article aims to describe and interpret results of LCA, allowing users to replicate the analysis. All LCA examples included in the text are illustrated using the Latent GOLD package, and command files needed to reproduce all analyses with SAS and R are available as supplemental online appendix files along with the example data files.},

	abstract = {In recognition of the 50th anniversary of the first manned lunar landing, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), together with the European Space Agency (ESA), revealed plans to resume manned exploration missions and to establish permanent human presence in outposts (habitats) on the Moon and Mars by 2040. In order to promote feasible and sustainable space exploration, these habitats are envisioned to be built from lunar and Martian in-situ resources. Our understanding of such indigenous resources, from materials science, construction and structural engineering points of view, is lacking and continues to hinder further development of Earth-independent habitats. In order to bridge this knowledge gap, a comprehensive assessment on the physical features and property characteristics of extraterrestrial construction materials such as those exploited from the Moon and Mars, mined from near-earth objects (NEOs), or cultured through modern technologies is presented herein. This review explores the suitability of construction materials derived from lunar and Martian regolith along with concrete derivatives, space-native metals and composites, as well as advanced and non-traditional materials for interplanetary construction. This review also identifies processing techniques suitable to produce non-terrestrial construction materials in the alien environment of space (i.e. vacuum, low gravity, etc.) and highlights emerging trends and future directions to stimulate further research in this area.},

However, how to frame feedback to achieve the best effect is an ongoing debate. In this study we analyse a written data-set of 174 segments of teacher feedback and student response, coded using 10 emergent feedback and 14 response categories. As it is argued that feedback is a dialogue between students and teacher, links between feedback and response segments are viewed as a dialogical framework that we visualise and understand using network analysis. From this network we conclude that some ways of formulating feedback are more productive and likely to lead to types of responses that signify learning than others. We thus identify the reflection group of responses, consisting of the categories reflective response, explanation and students investigate own thinking. The feedback categories that link primarily to the reflection group are open question, wondering question and leading question, which we categorise as the questioning group of feedback. We discuss these patterns against a previously published framework, and by discussing specific examples we further our understanding of what makes feedback formative.},

	abstract = {© 2016, American Physical Society. All rights reserved. We describe Module Analysis for Multiple Choice Responses (MAMCR), a new methodology for carrying out network analysis on responses to multiple choice assessments. This method is used to identify modules of non-normative responses which can then be interpreted as an alternative to factor analysis. MAMCR allows us to identify conceptual modules that are present in student responses that are more specific than the broad categorization of questions that is possible with factor analysis and to incorporate non-normative responses. Thus, this method may prove to have greater utility in helping to modify instruction. In MAMCR the responses to a multiple choice assessment are first treated as a bipartite, student X response, network which is then projected into a response X response network. We then use data reduction and community detection techniques to identify modules of non-normative responses. To illustrate the utility of the method we have analyzed one cohort of postinstruction Force Concept Inventory (FCI) responses. From this analysis, we find nine modules which we then interpret. The first three modules include the following: Impetus Force, More Force Yields More Results, and Force as Competition or Undistinguished Velocity and Acceleration. This method has a variety of potential uses particularly to help classroom instructors in using multiple choice assessments as diagnostic instruments beyond the Force Concept Inventory.},

	abstract = {© 2014 Bruun, Bearden. Studies of the time development of empirical networks usually investigate late stages where lasting connections have already stabilized. Empirical data on early network history are rare but needed for a better understanding of how social network topology develops in real life. Studying students who are beginning their studies at a university with no or few prior connections to each other offers a unique opportunity to investigate the formation and early development of link patterns and community structure in social networks. During a nine week introductory physics course, first year physics students were asked to identify those with whom they communicated about problem solving in physics during the preceding week. We use these students' self reports to produce time dependent student interaction networks. We investigate these networks to elucidate possible effects of different student attributes in early network formation. Changes in the weekly number of links show that while roughly half of all links change from week to week, students also reestablish a growing number of links as they progress through their first weeks of study. Using the Infomap community detection algorithm, we show that the networks exhibit community structure, and we use non-network student attributes, such as gender and end-of-course grade to characterize communities during their formation. Specifically, we develop a segregation measure and show that students structure themselves according to gender and pre-organized sections (in which students engage in problem solving and laboratory work), but not according to end-of-coure grade. Alluvial diagrams of consecutive weeks' communities show that while student movement between groups are erratic in the beginnning of their studies, they stabilize somewhat towards the end of the course. Taken together, the analyses imply that student interaction networks stabilize quickly and that students establish collaborations based on who is immediately available to them and on observable personal characteristics.},

Social network analysis (SNA) has been used in many educational studies in the past decade, but what these studies have in common is that the populations in question in most cases are defined and known to the researchers studying the networks. Snowball sampling is an SNA methodology most often used to study hidden populations, for example, groups of homosexual people, drug users or people with sexually transmitted diseases. By use of a snowball sampling approach, this study mapped municipal social networks of educational actors, who were otherwise hidden to the researchers. Subsequently, the resulting networks were validated through interviews with central respondents and by using prior investigations of the municipalities. Our results confirmed that the majority of the designated respondents recognized the resulting sociograms and their own position in these. It was also found that not all predictions based on existing knowledge of the municipalities aligned with SNA data. However, these discrepancies could be explained by development in the municipalities in the time following previous investigations. This study shows that snowball sampling is an applicable method to use for mapping hidden populations in educational settings, but also that qualitative studies are needed in order to interpret the networks in real-life contexts.},

	doi = {10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.9.020109},
	abstract = {The role of student interactions in learning situations is a foundation of sociocultural learning theory, and social network analysis can be used to quantify student relations. We discuss how self-reported student interactions can be viewed as processes of meaning making and use this to understand how quantitative measures that describe the position in a network, called centrality measures, can be understood in terms of interactions that happen in the context of a university physics course. We apply this discussion to an empirical data set of self-reported student interactions. In a weekly administered survey, first year university students enrolled in an introductory physics course at a Danish university indicated with whom they remembered having communicated within different interaction categories. For three categories pertaining to (1) communication about how to solve physics problems in the course (called the PS category), (2) communications about the nature of physics concepts (called the CD category), and (3) social interactions that are not strictly related to the content of the physics classes (called the ICS category) in the introductory mechanics course, we use the survey data to create networks of student interaction. For each of these networks, we calculate centrality measures for each student and correlate these measures with grades from the introductory course, grades from two subsequent courses, and the pretest Force Concept Inventory (FCI) scores. We find highly significant correlations (p{\textless}0.001) between network centrality measures and grades in all networks. We find the highest correlations between network centrality measures and future grades. In the network composed of interactions regarding problem solving (the PS network), the centrality measures hide and PageRank show the highest correlations (r=-0.32 and r=0.33, respectively) with future grades. In the CD network, the network measure target entropy shows the highest correlation (r=0.45) with future grades. In the network composed solely of noncontent related social interactions, these patterns of correlation are maintained in the sense that these network measures show the highest correlations and maintain their internal ranking. Using hierarchical linear regression, we find that a linear model that adds the network measures hide and target entropy, calculated on the ICS network, significantly improves a base model that uses only the FCI pretest scores from the beginning of the semester. Though one should not infer causality from these results, they do point to how social interactions in class are intertwined with academic interactions. We interpret this as an integral part of learning, and suggest that physics is a robust example.

This procedure was also used to judge the weight of evidence provided for the review by each study so that greater emphasis could be given to findings from the most relevant and methodologically sound research. The findings of the review by no means constitute a ringing endorsement of teachers? assessment; there was evidence of low reliability and bias in teachers? judgements made in certain circumstances.

A nationally representative sample of New Zealand secondary students (N= 705) responded to a 45-item Conceptions of Assessment inventory and a list of 12 assessment practices. Well-fitting measurement models were found. The more students agreed that assessment was to help them improve the more they associated assessment with teacher-controlled practices. Further, the more students perceived assessment as irrelevant the more they defined it as interactive-informal practices. Unlike recent assessment reform advocacy, the students associated teacher-controlled assessment practices with assessment for learning, while more student-oriented practices were conceived as creating a positive social environment that was irrelevant to learning.},

	title = {Using multimodal learning analytics to identify aspects of collaboration in project-based learning},
	abstract = {Collaborative learning activities are a key part of education and are part of many common teaching approaches including problem-based learning, inquiry-based learning, and project-based learning. However, in open-ended collaborative small group work where learners make unique solutions to tasks that involve robotics, electronics, programming, and design artefacts evidence on the effectiveness of using these learning activities are hard to find. The paper argues that multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) can offer novel methods that can generate unique information about what happens when students are engaged in collaborative, project-based learning activities. Through the use of multimodal learning analytics platform, we collected various streams of data, processed and extracted multimodal interactions to answer the following question: which features of MMLA are good predictors of collaborative problem-solving in open-ended tasks in project-based learning? Manual entered scores of CPS were regressed using machine-learning methods. The answer to the question provides potential ways to automatically identify aspects of collaboration in project- based learning. Introduction},

	abstract = {Recently, programming skills have become a core competence. Many teaching strategies were developed to improve programming skills. Among them, online tests were widely applied to enhance students learning. Nonetheless, they may not be able to engage students in deep thinking and reflections. Thus, a two-tier test strategy was proposed to address this issue. However, previous research mainly focused on investigating the effectiveness of the two-tier test strategy but there is a lack of studies that investigate why the two-tier test approach is effective. To this end, we developed an online test, where the two-tier test strategy was implemented. Additionally, an empirical study was conducted to explore the influences of the two-tier test approach on students' learning performance and behavior patterns. Pre-test and post-test scores were applied to assess students' learning performance while a lag sequential analysis was used to analyze behavior patterns. Regarding learning performance, the proposed two-tier test can improve students' programming skills. Regarding behavior patterns, the two-tier test approach facilitates students to develop a learning by reviewing strategy, which is useful to improve their programming skills.},

	abstract = {Inquiry learning has been developing for years and many countries have incorporated inquiry learning into the scope of K-12 education. Educators have indicated the importance of engaging students in knowledge-sharing activities during the inquiry learning process. In this study, a location-based augmented reality (AR) environment with a five-step guiding mechanism is developed to guide students to share knowledge in inquiry learning activities. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of promoting the knowledge sharing behaviors of students, an experiment has been conducted in an elementary school natural science course. The participants were 57 fourth-grade students from an elementary school in Northern Taiwan, divided into an experimental group of 28 students who learned with the AR-based approach and a control group of 29 students who learned with the conventional in-class mobile learning approach. The students' learning behaviors, including their movements in the real-world environment and interactions with peers, were recorded. Accordingly, the learning patterns and interactions of the two groups were analyzed via lag-sequential analysis and quantitative content analysis. It was found that, in comparison with the conventional inquiry-based mobile learning activity, the AR-based inquiry learning activity is able to engage the students in more interactions for knowledge construction. The findings of this study provide guidance for helping teachers develop effective strategies and learning designs for conducting inquiry-based learning activities. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {In recent decades, conceptualizations and operationalizations of self-regulated learning (SRL) have shifted from SRL as an aptitude to SRL as an event. Alongside this shift, increased technological capability has introduced computer log files to the investigation of SRL, uncovering new research avenues. One such avenue investigates the time-related characteristics of SRL through learners’ behavioural sequences. Although sequence analysis is still relatively new in SRL research, other fields have fruitful traditions in its application and may serve as a basis for applications in the field of SRL. Ten years of investigating SRL through sequence analysis have produced a wide range of methodological approaches. While this variety of methods illustrates the diversity of opportunities, it also indicates the lack of consensus regarding the most appropriate approach. Since the introduction of sequences analysis in the field of SRL, researchers have emphasized the need for a methodological framework to guide its application. Yet, to date, no such framework has been proposed, hindering our progress through (1) transparent methods and (2) comparative studies to (3) empirical and ecological applications. To help overcome this issue, this manuscript aims to foster discussions of a methodological framework for the use of sequence analysis in SRL research. We first make a case for why such a framework is necessary; secondly, we propose a set of considerations which could serve as a starting point for the construction of a framework.},

Analysis of observed behaviour using computational methods can uncover patterns that reflect theoretically established processes, such as those involved in self-regulated learning (SRL). This research addresses the question of how to integrate this bottom-up approach of mining behavioural patterns with the traditional top-down approach of using validated self-reporting instruments. Using process mining, we extracted interaction sequences from fine-grained behavioural traces for 3458 learners across three Massive Open Online Courses. We identified six distinct interaction sequence patterns. We matched each interaction sequence pattern with one or more theory-based SRL strategies and identified three clusters of learners. First, Comprehensive Learners, who follow the sequential structure of the course materials, which sets them up for gaining a deeper understanding of the content. Second, Targeting Learners, who strategically engage with specific course content that will help them pass the assessments. Third, Sampling Learners, who exhibit more erratic and less goal-oriented behaviour, report lower SRL, and underperform relative to both Comprehensive and Targeting Learners. Challenges that arise in the process of extracting theory-based patterns from observed behaviour are discussed, including analytic issues and limitations of available trace data from learning platforms.},

The methodology is framed in a structure where process data on interactions between the task performer and the task space environment are captured in a data stream for big data analytics. We begin by describing a reductionist approach that involves deconstructing complex processes into constituent parts. We extend this approach by looking at sequences of these constituent parts with the aim of detecting patterns in a person's action pathways. We propose the exploration of these pathways as indicators of underlying behavioural and cognitive processes. Current sequence-based approaches are presented and a proposed approach in dealing with sequences as empirical pathways is demonstrated using data stream from an interactive and collaborative online-administered complex task. These empirical pathways were visualised as directed graphs and an exploratory network analysis is proposed to examine specific features of the emergent paths. General challenges encountered during the development of such a method are described and specific future challenges that we foresee in transitioning from an exploratory phase to a confirmatory phase are examined. Finally, possibilities for further research as well as future applications are discussed.},

In our study, we recorded and summarized the gaming behaviors demonstrated by these participants over 335 days of observation from December 2009 to October 2010. We coded the recorded behaviors and conducted a frequency analysis, sequential analysis and cluster analysis to explore the behavioral distributions, behavioral-frequency transition and behavior-cluster patterns in the MMORPG.

There is limited research on the content, performance, and behavioral patterns of teaching using online discussions and integrated situated scenarios. This case study empirically explored the learning process of adopting collaborative online instructional discussion activities for the purpose of problem-solving using situated scenarios in a higher education course. Thirty-two university students carried out problem-solving activities on case scenarios and problem-solving tasks assigned by the teacher on the discussion forum. Two forms of instructional activities were considered: 1) problem-solving in a given scenario and 2) problem-solving when learners play roles in a given scenario. The activities mentioned above were each implemented for a week. Using analytical methods that combined qualitative and quantitative approaches, we conducted quantitative content analysis, qualitative protocol analysis, and cluster analysis. We compared the differences in the quality of discussions, patterns of cognitive structure, and patterns of the clusters of possible discussion behaviors. Our study suggests that, when compared to general situated learning activity, discussions are of better quality when they involve a role-playing activity, which also yields the most diverse options for solutions. However, when learners engage in either approach to situated learning, the cognitive aspects of application, evaluation, and innovation are often still found lacking. Our study discusses the observed behavioral patterns and learning-related limitations of these activities and provides specific recommendations for teachers and researchers.},

	abstract = {Individuals with strong self-regulated learning (SRL) skills, characterized by the ability to plan, manage and control their learning process, can learn faster and outperform those with weaker SRL skills. SRL is critical in learning environments that provide low levels of support and guidance, as is commonly the case in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Learners can be trained to engage in SRL and actively supported with prompts and activities. However, effective implementation of learner support systems in MOOCs requires an understanding of which SRL strategies are most effective and how these strategies manifest in online behavior. Moreover, identifying learner characteristics that are predictive of weaker SRL skills can advance efforts to provide targeted support without obtrusive survey instruments. We investigated SRL in a sample of 4,831 learners across six MOOCs based on individual records of overall course achievement, interactions with course content, and survey responses. Results indicated that goal setting and strategic planning predicted attainment of personal course goals, while help seeking appeared to be counterproductive. Learners with stronger SRL skills were more likely to revisit previously studied course materials, especially course assessments. Several learner characteristics, including demographics and motivation, predicted learners’ SRL skills. We discuss implications for theory and the development of learning environments that provide adaptive support.},

	abstract = {Online discussions have been widely utilized as an educational activity, and much research has been conducted on the process and behaviors involved in asynchronous discussions. However, research on behavioral patterns in learners’ synchronous discussions, including the process of social knowledge construction and project coordination is limited. Through the examination of the behavioral patterns and differences between students with high- and low-quality discussions, it may be possible to understand the limitations of knowledge construction in synchronous discussions. Furthermore, these findings may help teachers design and guide synchronous discussions activities. This study is an empirical case study in which college students conducted synchronous discussions based on topics specified by the teacher. The students used a text-based instant messaging (IM) tool in a period of 98 days. Two analytical methods were employed. The coding of the discussion messages was followed by a quantitative content analysis and a lag sequential analysis of behaviors. The social knowledge construction, project coordination, and social interactions in the group discussion were explored. Furthermore, the differences between the behavioral patterns of the high- and low-quality discussion groups were also examined. The findings indicate that although more than half of the discussion messages were off-topic, there were also some knowledge construction behavioral sequences. Furthermore, there were several limitations on the diversity and depth of the knowledge construction in the students’ discussions. The high-quality discussion teams performed better than the low-quality discussion teams in terms of participation, diversity in knowledge construction, and coordination. However, they also had more off-topic discussions. In this paper, we discuss these behavioral patterns and provide specific suggestions for teachers regarding how to implement synchronous discussions that are targeted to students’ knowledge construction processes.},

The analysis of these data, although highly relevant for decision making, cannot be performed di-rectly by business users, as its execution requires very specific technical knowledge in areas such as statistics and data mining. One of the com-plexity problems faced when constructing an analysis of this kind resides in the fact that most data mining tools and techniques work exclusively over tabular-formatted data, preventing business users from analysing excerpts of a data bundle which have not been previously traduced into this format by an expert. In response, this work presents a set of transfor-mation patterns for automatically generating tabular data from domain models. The described patterns have been integrated into a language, which allows business users to specify the elements of a domain model that should be considered for data analysis.},

They were paired based on self-selection. Each dyad was asked to collaborate on eight moderately structured problems concerning Newtonian mechanics.

Inthis context, instruction assisted development as students designed models of the pond in one-gallon jars and attempted to stabilize these jars in sustainable ecosystems that could be used to study questions about the ponds. Unintendedoutcomes(e.g., algal blooms, bacteria colonies)became opportunities to learn how aquatic systems function. Efforts to model aquatic functioningwerecomplemented byweekly research meetings that served as a forum for conjecture and test of relations between evidence and questions. At the end of the year students responded to individual interviews about their understandings of ecologyandresearchdesign, along with theirbeliefs about the epis- temology of inquiry. Results suggest that participation in carefully crafted, extended investigations transformed students? views of the goals and purposes of inquiry and of the nature of science.},

	abstract = {The human brain is a complex, interconnected network par excellence. Accurate and informative mapping of this human connectome has become a central goal of neuroscience. At the heart of this endeavor is the notion that brain connectivity can be abstracted to a graph of nodes, representing neural elements (e.g., neurons, brain regions), linked by edges, representing some measure of structural, functional or causal interaction between nodes. Such a representation brings connectomic data into the realm of graph theory, affording a rich repertoire of mathematical tools and concepts that can be used to characterize diverse anatomical and dynamical properties of brain networks. Although this approach has tremendous potential - and has seen rapid uptake in the neuroimaging community - it also has a number of pitfalls and unresolved challenges which can, if not approached with due caution, undermine the explanatory potential of the endeavor. We review these pitfalls, the prevailing solutions to overcome them, and the challenges at the forefront of the field. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Geological maps are complex in particular because 3-dimensional features must be inferred from 2-dimensional representations depicted by differing line types and weights. Modeling building, as an internal mental activity, is also required in order to achieve deep understanding of textual materials in geology, of geological maps, as well as in understanding complex causal processes, e.g., convection, underlying geological phenomena. Using literature from Cognitive Psychology, a framework for teaching and learning with visualizations in Plate Tectonics is given as an example of one difficult topic in Geology which involves the understanding of visualizations. Based on previous work in students' conceptions in Geology, three studies of students' conceptions and cognition in plate tectonics were designed. These studies highlight the importance of progressive model-building as a good pedagogical approach, as well as examine the efficacy of different learning tasks as strategies to promote model-building on the part of learners.},

Hopefully the papers will deepen understanding and move the research field forward. The ubiquity of models in the history and current practice of science is widely recognised. In the past half-century historians and philosophers of science have devoted considerable time to documenting and understanding the role of models in science and social science. A minority of studies have engaged with the central epistemic question of the truth-status of models, and of how models relate, or do not relate, to the real-world processes that they are putatively representing. In Education research there has been a rich vein of such research investigating the use of models as aids to memory, as ways of bridging between the experience and understanding of learners and the more abstract theories of science; and there has been a lot of research on the efficacy of children?s own experiences of model construction and testing. Attention to the epistemological side of model construction, functioning and testing is of special current importance because of the unprecedented importance being given to ?Nature of Science? objectives in science curricula around the world.},

	issn = {15549178},
	doi = {10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.6.010103},
	abstract = {The Force Concept Inventory (FCI) is an important diagnostic instrument which is widely used in the field of physics education research. It is therefore very important to evaluate and monitor its functioning using different tools for statistical analysis. One of such tools is the stochastic Rasch model, which enables construction of linear measures for persons and items from raw test scores and which can provide important insight in the structure and functioning of the test (how item difficulties are distributed within the test, how well the items fit the model, and how well the items work together to define the underlying construct). The data for the Rasch analysis come from the large-scale research conducted in 2006-07, which investigated Croatian high school students? conceptual understanding of mechanics on a representative sample of 1676 students (age 17?18 years). The instrument used in research was the FCI. The average FCI score for the whole sample was found to be (27.7�0.4)\%, indicating that most of the students were still non-Newtonians at the end of high school, despite the fact that physics is a compulsory subject in Croatian schools. The large set of obtained data was analyzed with the Rasch measurement computer software WINSTEPS 3.66. Since the FCI is routinely used as pretest and post-test on two very different types of population (non-Newtonian and predominantly Newtonian), an additional predominantly Newtonian sample (N=141, average FCI score of 64.5\%) of first year students enrolled in introductory physics course at University of Zagreb was also analyzed. The Rasch model based analysis suggests that the FCI has succeeded in defining a sufficiently unidimensional construct for each population. The analysis of fit of data to the model found no grossly misfitting items which would degrade measurement. Some items with larger misfit and items with significantly different difficulties in the two samples of students do require further examination. The analysis revealed some problems with item distribution in the FCI and suggested that the FCI may function differently in non-Newtonian and predominantly Newtonian population. Some possible improvements of the test are suggested.},

The model transforms students' raw test scores through a nonlinear regression process into a scaled proficiency rating, which can be used to compare results obtained with different test questions. IRT also provides a theoretical approach to address ceiling effect and guessing. We applied IRT to analyze the Force Concept Inventory (FCI). The data was collected from 2802 students taking intro level mechanics courses at The Ohio State University. The data was analyzed with a 3-parameter item response model for multiple choice questions. We describe the procedures of the analysis and discuss the results and the interpretations. The analysis outcomes are compiled to provide a detailed IRT measurement metric of the FCI, which can be easily referenced and used by teachers and researchers for a range of assessment applications.},

Self-efficacy as a theory to explain human behavior change [Bandura [1977] Psychological Review, 84(2), 191?215] has become a focus of education researchers. Zeldin and Pajares [Zeldin \& Pajares [2000] American Educational Research Journal, 37(1), 215] and Zeldin, Britner, and Pajares [2008] Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 45(9), 1036?1058] found evidence that men and women draw on different sources for evaluation of their self-efficacy in science fields. Further, self-efficacy is one of the primary dimensions of students? overall science identity and contributes to their persistence in physics [Hazari, Sonnert, Sadler, \& Shanahan, 2010 Journal of Research in Science Teaching 47(8), 978?1003]. At Florida International University we have examined the self-efficacy of students in the introductory physics classes from the perspective of gender theory, with the intention of understanding the subtleties in how sources of self-efficacy provide a mechanism for understanding retention in physics. Using a sequential logistic regression analysis we uncover subtle distinctions in the predictive ability of the sources of self-efficacy. Predicting the probability of passing for women relies primarily on the vicarious learning experiences source, with no significant contribution from the social persuasion experiences, while predicting the probability of passing for men requires only the mastery experiences source.

It includes recommendations for teaching the next generation of life science investigators, through: Building a strong interdisciplinary curriculum that includes physical science, information technology, and mathematics. Eliminating the administrative and financial barriers to cross-departmental collaboration. Evaluating the impact of medical college admissions testing on undergraduate biology education. Creating early opportunities for independent research. Designing meaningful laboratory experiences into the curriculum. The committee presents a dozen brief case studies of exemplary programs at leading institutions and lists many resources for biology educators.

We introduce basic concepts in SNA, along with methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis, using a previously collected example study on an undergraduate biology classroom as a tutorial. We conduct descriptive analyses of the structure of the network of costudying relationships.We explore generative processes that create observed study networks between students and also test for an association between network position and success on exams. We also cover practical issues, such as the unique aspects of human subjects review for network studies. Our aims are to convince readers that using SNA in classroom environments allows rich and informative analyses to take place and to provide some initial tools for doing so, in the process inspiring future educational studies incorporating relational data.},

In this paper, we argue for an expanded role for this concept of levels in science education. We show confusion of levels (and "slippage" between levels) as the source of many of people's deep misunderstandings about patterns and phenomena in the world. These misunderstandings are evidenced not only in students' difficulties in the formal study of science but also in their misconceptions about experiences in their everyday lives. The StarLogo modeling language is designed as a medium for students to build models of multi-leveled phenomena and through these constructions explore the concept of levels. We describe several case studies of students working in StarLogo. The cases illustrate students' difficulties with the concept of levels, and how they can begin to develop richer understandings.},

	abstract = {One hundred years after its conception, the scientific method continues to reinforce a kind of cultural lore about what it means to participate in inquiry. As commonly implemented in venues ranging frommiddle school classrooms to undergraduate laboratories, it emphasizes the testing of predictions rather than ideas, focuses learners on material activity at the expense of deep subject matter understanding, and lacks epistemic framing relevant to the discipline. While critiques of the scientific method are not new, its cumulative effects on learners? conceptions of science have not been clearly articulated. We discuss these effects using findings from a series of five studies with degree-holding graduates of our educational system who were preparing to enter the teaching profession and apprentice their own young learners into unproblematic images of howscience is done. We then offer an alternative vision for investigative science?model-based inquiry (MBI)? as a system of activity and discourse that engages learners more deeply with content and embodies five epistemic characteristics of scientific knowledge: that ideas represented in the form of models are testable, revisable, explanatory, conjectural, and generative. We represent MBI as an interconnected set of classroom conversations and provide examples of its implementation and its limitations.},

	abstract = {Modeling is a core practice in science and a central part of scientific literacy. We present theoretical and empirical motivation for a learning progression for scientific modeling that aims to make the practice accessible and meaningful for learners. We define scientific modeling as including the elements of the practice (constructing, using, evaluating, and revising scientific models) and the metaknowledge that guides and motivates the practice (e.g., understanding the nature and purpose of models). Our learning progression for scientific modeling includes two dimensions that combine metaknowledge and elements of practice - scientific models as tools for predicting and explaining, and models change as understanding improves. We describe levels of progress along these two dimensions of our progression and illustrate them with classroom examples from 5th and 6th graders engaged in modeling. Our illustrations indicate that both groups of learners productively engaged in constructing and revising increasingly accurate models that included powerful explanatory mechanisms, and applied these models to make predictions for closely related phenomena. Furthermore, we show how students engaged in modeling practices move along levels of this progression. In particular, students moved from illustrative to explanatory models, and developed increasingly sophisticated views of the explanatory nature of models, shifting from models as correct or incorrect to models as encompassing explanations for multiple aspects of a target phenomenon. They also developed more nuanced reasons to revise models. Finally, we present challenges for learners in modeling practices - such as understanding how constructing a model can aid their own sensemaking, and seeing model building as a way to generate new knowledge rather than represent what they have already learned. � 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Abstract: Following two decades of corroboration, modeling theory is presented as a pedagogical theory that promotes mediated experiential learning of model-laden theory and inquiry in science education. Students develop experiential knowledge about physical realities through interplay between their own ideas about the physical world and particular patterns in this world. Under teacher mediation, they represent each pattern with a particular model that they develop through a five-phase learning cycle, following particular modeling schemata of well-defined dimensions and rules of engagement. Significantly greater student achievement has been increasingly demonstrated under mediated modeling than under conventional instruction of lecture and demonstration, especially in secondary school and university physics courses. The improved achievement is reflected in more meaningful understanding of course materials, better learning styles, higher success rates, lower attrition rates and narrower gaps between students of different backgrounds.},

Several authors have argued for a pragmatic approach to representation that takes users and their interpretations into account. It appears to me, however, that this emphasis on representation places excessive limitations on our view of models and their epistemic value. Models should rather be thought of as epistemic artifacts through which we gain knowledge in diverse ways. Approaching models this way stresses their materiality and media- specificity. Focusing on models as multi-functional artifacts loosens them from any pre-established and fixed representational relationships and leads me to argue for a two-fold approach to representation.},

The individual evaluates the model by attempting to generate alternative causal explanations for the events in the model. We contrast models-of-data theory with other proposals for how data are cognitively represented and show that models-of-data theory gives a good account of the pattern of written evaluations of data produced by the undergraduates in the study.

The FCI was administered twice to one hundred students during the first week of classes in an electricity and magnetism course with no review of mechanics between test administrations. High Kuder?Richardson reliability coefficient values, which estimate the average correlation of scores obtained on all possible halves of the test, suggest strong internal consistency. However, 31\% of the responses changed from test to retest, suggesting weak reliability for individual questions. A chi-square analysis shows that change in responses was neither consistent nor completely random. The puzzling conclusion is that although individual FCI responses are not reliable, the FCI total score is highly reliable.},

Then a curricular framework with a prominent energy-as-substance conceptual metaphor is described. The curricular framework involves both a reorganization of the content of introductory physics as well as a renewed focus. Reorganizing includes treating energy early and spiraling back to energy treatments. The refocusing includes emphasizing energys role in modeling phenomena and attending to the tools for representing energy conservation, storage, and transfer. Implementation of the energy framework is then described in the context of a Modeling Instruction course. Finally, qualitative evidence is presented showing student use of energy conceptual resources which are promoted in the curricular implementation.},

Unfortunately, because of the nature of empirical reports, much detail about the instruction that students in these studies received is seldom provided. In this article we describe the commitments and research that went into the design of a 9-week high school course in evolutionary biology. This course was designed to bring students to an understanding of the practice of evolutionary biology by engaging them in developing, elaborating, and using one of the discipline's most important explanatory models - Darwin's model of natural selection. This article is not an empirical report on student understanding but is instead a description of our view of what constitutes understanding in evolution and of a curriculum designed from this perspective. Examples of student work are used to add richness to the description of the course as well as to illustrate the potential for sophisticated reasoning that exists when students are given the opportunity and conceptual tools to engage in realistic inquiry. � 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The range of ontological states available for the notion of ?model? is outlined, together with the modes available for their representation. Issues in the selection of models for and the development of modelling skills within the model-based curriculum are presented. It is suggested that learning within such a curriculum entails: acquiring an acceptable understanding of what a model is and how modelling takes place; having a developed capacity to mentally visualise models; understanding the natures of analogy and of metaphor, processes which are central to models and modelling. The emphases required in teaching for this learning to be supported are discussed. Finally, implications of the model-based curriculum for teacher education are evaluated. It is concluded that a great deal of detailed research and development will be needed if the potential of this change in emphasis within the science curriculum is to be realised.},

Models have the fortuitous feature of making forms of student reasoning public and inspectable?not only among the community of modelers, but also to teachers. Modeling provides feedback about student thinking that can guide teaching decisions, an important dividend for improv- ing professional practice},

The very nature of some scienti�c domains contributes to the learning dif�culties students? experience. Phenomena in these domains are composed of multiple organization levels featuring complicated interactions within and across these levels.Molec- ular genetics is a compelling example of such a domain. Current instructional practices in genetics leave students ill prepared to bene�t from technological advances in genetics or to participate in public discussions about genetic issues. We argue that instruction in ge- netics needs to be refocused such that it promotes generative understandings of the genetic mechanisms that are at the core of modern genetics. This paper presents the early stages of design-based research involving the development and study of a curriculum unit in genetics for high school students.We employed several design strategies to make the structure and mechanisms of genetic phenomena salient in the activities of the unit. Our findings suggest that the curriculum does, to a large extent, engender a deeper understanding of genetic phenomena. Speci�cally, we observed gains in students? understanding of the genetic in- formation and the mechanisms that link genes to traits.},

Grounded in a sociocultural and sociocognitive approach to learning, epistemic games are designed to foster situated learning that leads to data structures with high levels of dependencies. As one might expect, traditional measurement models struggle to accommodate such contextual dependencies, especially when data are collected at smaller scales and epistemic network analysis (ENA) has been developed to provide a practically feasible modeling alternative (e.g., Rupp et al., 2009; Shaffer et al., in press). In this paper, we describe a research program that addresses key statistical considerations for modeling data from epistemic games using ENA with an eye toward representing different learning progressions of players within such games. Current approaches for representing learning progressions using ENA are juxtaposed with approaches for simulating such data using particular statistical constraints.},

	abstract = {Data from a voluntary association are used to construct new formal model for a traditional anthropological problem, fission in small groups. The process leading to fission is viewed as an unequa flow of sentiments and information cross the ties in a social network. This flow is unequal because it is uniquely constrained by the contextual range and sensitivity of each relationship in the network.The subsequent differential sharing of sentiments leads to the formation of subgroups with more internal stability than the group as a whole, and results in fission. The Ford-Fulkerson labeling algorithm allows an accurat prediction of membership in the subgroup and of the locus of the fission to be made from measurements of the potential for information flow across each edge in the network. Methods for measuremet of potential information flow are discussed, and it is shown that all appropriate techniques will generate
the same predictions.},

.learning resources from distributed repositories, to take into account the context and to
allow dynamic adaptation to different learners based on substantial advances in
pedagogical theories and knowledge models. We focus on learning systems using a
problem-based learning approach represented by scenarios. In our framework, the goal
of scenarios is to describe the learning and tutoring activities to acquire some
knowledge domain (for instance physics) and know-how to solve a particular problem.
The main issue is to design a generic scenario which can deal with most of learning
situations for problem-based learning science curriculum. From a generic scenario, the
learning system will compute on the fly a particular scenario dedicated to the current
learner and its learning situation. The main contribution of this paper is a semantic and
didactic-based model of scenarios for designing an adaptive and context-aware
learning System. The scenario model is acquired from: i) the know-how and real
practices of teachers ii) the theory in didactic anthropology of knowledge of Chevallard
[1]; iii) a hierarchical task model.},

	doi = {10.1207/s1532690xci2302_1},
	abstract = {We argue that learning about the nature and utility of scientific models and engaging in the process of creating and testing models should be a central focus of science education. To realize this vision, we created and evaluated the Model-Enhanced ThinkerTools (METT) Curriculum, which is an inquiry-oriented physics curriculum for middle school students in which they learn about the nature of scientific models and engage in the process of modeling. Key components of our approach include enabling students to create computer models that express their own theories of force and motion, evaluate their models using criteria such as accuracy and plausibility, and engage in discussions about models and the process of modeling. Curricular trials in four science classes of an urban middle school indicate that this approach can facilitate a significant improvement in students' understanding of modeling. Further analyses revealed that the approach was particularly successful in clarifying and broadening students' understanding of the nature and purpose of models. The METT Curriculum also led to significant improvements in inquiry skills and physics knowledge. Comparisons of METT students' performance with that of prior ThinkerTools students suggest that the acquisition of metamodeling knowledge contributed to these gains. In particular, METT students wrote significantly better conclusions on the inquiry test and performed better on some of the far-transfer problems on the physics test. Finally, correlational results, including significant correlations of pretest modeling and inquiry scores with posttest physics scores, suggests that developing knowledge of modeling and inquiry transfers to the learning of science content within such a curriculum. Taken together, the findings suggest that an emphasis on model-based inquiry, accompanied by the development of metamodeling knowledge, can facilitate learning science content while also developing students' understanding of the scientific enterprise.},

In this earlier work such concepts were further linked to forms of knowledge that are lsquotroublesomersquo, after the work of Perkins (1999). It was argued that these twinned sets of ideas may define critical moments of irreversible conceptual transformation in the educational experiences of learners, and their teachers. The present study aims (a) to examine the extent to which such phenomena can be located within personal understandings of discipline-specific epistemological discourses, (b) to develop more extensively notions of liminality within learning that were raised in the first paper, and (c) to propose a conceptual framework within which teachers may advance their own reflective practice.},

The authors test an adaptation to case-based learning that facilitates abstracting problem-solving schemas from examples and using them to solve further problems: analogical encoding, or learning by drawing a comparison across examples. In 3 studies, the authors examined schema abstraction and transfer among novices learning negotiation strategies. Experiment 1 showed a benefit for analogical learning relative to no case study. Experiment 2 showed a marked advantage for comparing two cases over studying the 2 cases separately. Experiment 3 showed that increasing the degree of comparison support increased the rate of transfer in a face-to-face dynamic negotiation exercise.},

They therefore have an important place in both the formal and informal science education provision made for people of all ages. This book is a product of five years collaborative work by eighteen researchers from four countries. It addresses four key issues: the roles of models in science and their implications for science education; the place of models in curricula for major science subjects; the ways that models can be presented to, are learned about, and can be produced by, individuals; the implications of all these for research and for science teacher education. The work draws on insights from the history and philosophy of science, cognitive psychology, sociology, linguistics, and classroom research, to establish what may be done and what is done. The book will be of interest to researchers in science education and to those taking courses of advanced study throughout the world.},

	abstract = {A main goal of science education is to help students learn to reason scientifically. A main way to facilitate learning is to engage students in inquiry activities such as conducting experiments. This article presents a theoretical framework for evaluating inquiry tasks in terms of how similar they are to authentic science. The framework helps identify the respects in which these reasoning tasks are similar to and different from real scientific research. The framework is based on a recent theory of reasoning, models-of-data theory. We argue that inquiry tasks commonly used in schools evoke reasoning processes that are qualitatively different from the processes employed in real scientific inquiry. Moreover, school reasoning tasks appear to be based on an epistemology that differs from the epistemology of authentic science. Inquiry tasks developed by researchers have increasingly captured features of authentic science, but further improvement is still possible. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our analysis for research, assessment, and instruction. � 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed 86:175-218, 2002; DOI 10.1002/sce.10001},

When SFL was used in a technology-rich, tenth grade (15-16 years of age) biology classroom, extensive data ranging from preconceptions tests to videotapes, projects and computer logs of work sessions were collected. This paper describes the student?s learning goals, gains and activities with particular attention to interactions with representations, then contrasts them with those of classmates. The representations accessed by the learner were analysed with respect to con- tributions to mental models, the challenges posed by the representations and the effectiveness of the interface in overcoming those challenges. This rich and systematic description of model-building with multimedia enabled the formation of an initial model of model-based learning in this context.},

We noted that a full-blown analysis using IRT would be a next logical step, which several authors have since taken. In this paper, we show that our simple approach not only yields similar conclusions in the analysis of the performance of items on the FCI to the more sophisticated and complex IRT analyses but also permits additional insights by characterizing both the correct and incorrect answer choices. Our IRC approach can be applied to a variety of multiple-choice assessments but, as applied to a carefully designed instrument such as the FCI, allows us to probe student understanding as a function of ability level through an examination of each answer choice. We imagine that physics teachers could use IRC analysis to identify prominent misconceptions and tailor their instruction to combat those misconceptions, fulfilling the FCI authors? original intentions for its use. Furthermore, the IRC analysis can assist test designers to improve their assessments by identifying nonfunctioning distractors that can be replaced with distractors attractive to students at various ability levels.},

While the success of this pedagogical approach has been recognized within the physics community, the use of models and modeling practices is still being developed for biology. Drawing from the existing research on UMI in physics, we describe the theoretical foundations of UMI and how UMI can be adapted to include an emphasis on models and modeling for undergraduate introductory biology courses.

Thirteen well-established scientists from different parts of the world, working in experimental or theoretical research, in both traditional fields such as astrophysics and rapidly growing research fields such as molecular biology, completed an open-ended questionnaire about the NOS and participated in in-depth interviews. The descriptions of their practices provide a somewhat striking contrast to the image of science usually portrayed in science curricula and textbooks. These accounts of authentic scientific practice have considerable potential for development into interesting cases as teaching resources to enhance and enrich students' understanding of NOS and for the design of more effective laboratory work and field experience. � 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	doi = {10.2307/3233668},
	abstract = {Our objective has been to develop an instructional theory and corresponding curricular materials that make scientific inquiry accessible to a wide range of students, including younger and lower achieving students. We hypothesized that this could be achieved by recognizing the importance of metacognition and creating an instructional approach that develops students' metacognitive knowledge and skills through a process of scaffolded inquiry, reflection, and generalization. Toward this end, we collaborated with teachers to create a computer enhanced, middle school science curriculum that engages students in learning about and reflecting on the processes of scientific inquiry as they construct increasingly complex models of force and motion phenomena. The resulting ThinkerTools Inquiry Curriculum centers around a metacognitive model of research, called the Inquiry Cycle, and a metacognitive process, called Reflective Assessment, in which students reflect on their own and each other's inquiry. In this article, we report on instructional trials of the curriculum by teachers in urban classrooms, including a controlled comparison to determine the impact of including or not including the Reflective Assessment Process. Overall, the curriculum proved successful and students' performance improved significantly on both physics and inquiry assessments. The controlled comparison revealed that students' learning was greatly facilitated by Reflective Assessment. Furthermore, adding this metacognitive process to the curriculum was particularly beneficial for low-achieving students: Performance on their research projects and inquiry tests was significantly closer to that of high-achieving students than was the case in the control classes. Thus, this approach has the valuable effect of reducing the educational disadvantage of low-achieving students while also being beneficial for high-achieving students. We argue that these findings have strong implications for what such metacognitively focused, inquiry-oriented curricula can accomplish, particularly in urban school settings in which there are many disadvantaged students.},

In this paper, we identify three goals of engaging in these related scientific practices: (1) sensemaking, (2) articulating, and (3) persuading. We propose using these goals to understand student engagement with these practices, and to design instructional interventions to support students. Thus, we use this framework as a lens to investigate the question: What successes and challenges do students face as they engage in the scientific practices of explanation and argumentation? We study this in the context of a curriculum that provides students and teachers with an instructional framework for constructing and defending scientific explanations. Through this analysis, we find that students consistently use evidence to make sense of phenomenon and articulate those understandings but they do not consistently attend to the third goal of persuading others of their understandings. Examining the third goal more closely reveals that persuading others of an understanding requires social interactions that are often inhibited by traditional classroom interactions. Thus, we conclude by proposing design strategies for addressing the social challenges inherent in the related scientific practices of explanation and argumentation. � 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This research examines how problem solving in the domain of Mendelian genetics proceeds in situations where solvers' mental models are insufficient to solve problems at hand (model-revising problem solving). Such situations require solvers to use existing models to recognize anomalous data and to revise those models to accommodate the data. The study was conducted in the context of 9-week high school genetics course and addressed: the heuristics charactenstic of successful model-revising problem solving: the nature of the model revisions, made by students as well as the nature of model development across problem types; and the basis upon which solvers decide that a revised model is sufficient (that t has both predictive and explanatory power). � 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Although an asserted parallel between these underpins reform, little is actually known about this relation. This article offers a model of this relation that draws coherent connections between the science studies literature, which suggests ways of conceiving how scientific knowledge is created; and sociocultural learning theory, which suggests ways of conceiving scientific reasoning. This model highlights a dialectic between construction and critique of claims in both scientific reasoning and practice. A ldquograsprdquo of scientific practice as such is instrumental to learning because informational content of scientific knowledge lies not only on the level of facts, but also on the levels of methods and values, and coordinating information across these levels is crucial for understanding. In contrast to prevailing constructivist ideas that highlight student authority to construct knowledge as scientists do, this model emphasizes the importance of knowing how to hold claims accountable. Thus, the ideal vision of students making their own sense of content is superceded by a more defensible ideal vision of students learning how to make scientific sense of content. � 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To help facilitate this process, we present a new classroom observation protocol known as the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM or COPUS. This protocol allows STEM faculty, after a short 1.5-hour training period, to reliably characterize how faculty and students are spending their time in the classroom. We present the protocol, discuss how it differs from existing classroom observation protocols, and describe the process by which it was developed and validated. We also discuss how the observation data can be used to guide individual and institutional change.},

	abstract = {Reassembling the Social is a fundamental challenge from one of the world's leading social theorists to how we understand society and the 'social'. Bruno Latour's contention is that the word 'social' as used by Social Scientists has become laden with assumptions to the point where it has become a misnomer. When the adjective is applied to a phenomenon, it is used to indicate a stabilized state of affairs, a bundle of ties that in due course may be used to account for another phenomenon. Latour also finds the word used as if it described a type of material, in a comparable way to an adjective such as 'wooden' or 'steely'.

Rather than simply indicating what is already assembled together, it is now used in a way that makes assumptions about the nature of what is assembled. It has become a word that designates two distinct things: a process of assembling: and a type of material, distinct from others. Latour shows why "the social" cannot be thought of as a kind of material or domain, and disputes attempts to provide a "social explanation" of other states of affairs. While these attempts have been productive (and probably necessary) in the past, the very success of the social sciences mean that they are largely no longer so. At the present stage it is no longer possible to inspect the precise constituents entering the social domain. Latour returns to the original meaning of "the social" to redefine the notion and allow it to trace connections again. It will then be possible to resume the traditional goal of the social sciences, but using more refined tools. Drawing on his extensive work examining the "assemblages" of nature, Latour finds it necessary to scrutinize thoroughly the exact content of what is assembled under the umbrella of Society. This approach, a "sociology of associations" has become known as Actor-Network-Theory, and this book is an essential introduction both for those seeking to understand Actor-Network-Theory, or the ideas of one of its most influential proponents.},

Social network studies have been pursued for some time in social science disciplines, where numerous descriptive methods for analyzing them have been proposed. More recently, interest in the analysis of social network data has grown among statisticians, who have developed more elaborate models and methods for fitting them to network data. This article reviews fundamentals of, and recent innovations in, social network analysis using a physician influence network as an example. After introducing forms of network data, basic network statistics, and common descriptive measures, it describes two distinct types of statistical models for network data: individual-outcome models in which networks enter the construction of explanatory variables, and relational models in which the network itself is a multivariate dependent variable. Complexities in estimating both types of models arise due to the complex correlation structures among outcome measures.},

This study investigated whether participants who could solve well-defined physics problems could also solve a real-world physics problem that involved the need to make assumptions. The participants, who all had at least a BA in physics, were videotaped ldquothinking aloudrdquo while solving three well-defined and one real-world problem and then interviewed about the problem-solving process. All the problems dealt with the same scientific content. The recordings were analyzed to identify similarities and differences in the ways the problems were solved and to see which steps in the solution of the problems posed the greatest cognitive difficulty for each participant. Results indicate that (a) the process of making the constraining assumptions needed to convert the real-world problem into a well-defined one was the most difficult step for all, and (b) only the participants who had prior experience making constraining assumptions were able to make the needed assumptions and solve the real-world problem. These findings suggest a need to support physics students develop this important skill. � 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed 93:86-108, 2009},

To explore this topic, two categories are introduced that classify how students' understanding of the nature of science has been operationalized.

Proximal knowledge of the nature of science is students' personal understandings, beliefs, and commitments regarding their own science learning and the scientific knowledge they - not scientists - produce and encounter. It is suggested that viewing these two kinds of knowledge structures within modern information processing frameworks that delineate roles of epistemological and metacognitive knowledge in learning can guide future research on students' knowledge about the nature of science as a mediator, not just an outcome, of their science experiences in school. � 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

This is a complex practice that entails three overlapping, instructional goals: Participants articulate their understandings andworkto persuade others of those understandings in order to make sense of the phenomenon under study (L. K. Berland \& B. J. Reiser, 2009). This study examines the argumentative discussions that emerged in two middle school science classrooms to explore variation in howthe goals of sensemaking and persuasion were taken up. Our analyses reveals that each classroom engagedwith these two goals but that they did so quite differently.These differences suggest that the students in each class had overlapping but different interpretations of argumentation. In addition, comparing across the class? arguments suggests these two goals of scientific argumentation may be in tension with one another.},

Recent work in cognitive science has challenged this purely conceptual view of learning, emphasising the role of language, and the importance of personal and contextual aspects of understanding science. The research described in this paper is designed around the notion that learning involves the recognition and development of students? representational resources. In particular, we argue that conceptual difficulties with the concept of force are fundamentally representational in nature. This paper describes a classroom sequence in force that focuses on representations and their negotiation, and reports on the effectiveness of this perspective in guiding teaching, and in providing insight into student learning. Classroom sequences involving three teachers were videotaped using a combined focus on the teacher and groups of students. Video analysis software was used to capture the variety of representations used, and sequences of representational negotiation. Stimulated recall interviews were conducted with teachers and students. The paper reports on the nature of the pedagogies developed as part of this representational focus, its effectiveness in supporting student learning, and on the pedagogical and epistemological challenges negotiated by teachers in implementing this approach.},

?Enhancing Teaching and Learning Environments? (ETL)1. This forms part of the large scale ESRC
Teaching and Learning Research Programme Phase 2. ETL is seeking to identify factors leading to high
quality learning environments within five disciplinary contexts across a range of HE institutions. Meyer?s
notion of a threshold concept was introduced into project discussions on learning outcomes as a particular
basis for differentiating between core learning outcomes that represent ?seeing things in a new way? and
those that do not. A threshold concept is thus seen as something distinct within what university teachers
would typically describe as ?core concepts?. Furthermore, threshold concepts may represent, or lead to,
what Perkins (1999) describes as ?troublesome knowledge? ? knowledge that is conceptually difficult,
counter-intuitive or ?alien?. The paper attempts to define characteristics of threshold concepts and, in the
light of Perkins? work, to indicate correspondences between the notion of threshold concepts and that of

In doing this, we briefly review the paradigm ?wars? and incompatibility thesis, we show some commonalities between quantitative and qualitative research, we explain the tenets of pragmatism, we explain the fundamental principle of mixed research and how to apply it, we provide specific sets of designs for the two major types of mixed methods research (mixed-model designs and mixed-method designs), and, finally, we explain mixed methods research as following (recursively) an eight-step process. A key feature of mixed methods research is its methodological pluralism or eclecticism, which frequently results in superior research (compared to monomethod research). Mixed methods research will be successful as more investigators study and help advance its concepts and as they regularly practice it.},

paper stems from the United States undergraduate research movement, which started by
providing research opportunities for selected students in selected institutions. We argue,
as does much recent US experience, that such curricular experience should and can be
mainstreamed for all or many students through a research-active curriculum. We argue
that this can be achieved through structured interventions at course team, departmental,
institutional and national levels. The argument is complemented by a large selection of
mini case studies, drawn particularly from the UK, North America and Australasia.
This paper addresses four main audiences:
?? Academic staff (or faculty in North America) who are interested in engaging their
students in research, either as part of the curriculum or as co-researchers;
?? Course leaders, department heads and staff with faculty and institutional
responsibilities for research and teaching and learning who wish to develop
strategies and practices to support undergraduate students undertaking and
understanding the nature of research;
?? Staff engaged in educational and research development in universities, including
Academy staff in the Subject Centres and in Academy York, who support staff in
developing linkages between research and teaching;
?? Institutional and national higher education policy makers, including professional
bodies and those giving research grants, who are concerned to develop policies to
encourage undergraduates to become involved with research.},

public spaces: the exhibits should facilitate science learning, yet they also need to support
a diverse visiting public in making their own personal choices about where to attend, what
to do, and how to interpret their interactions. To be effective as teaching tools, exhibits
need to be highly intrinsically motivating at every step of an interaction in order to sustain
involvement by an audience who views their visit primarily as a leisure activity. Given
these challenges, it is vital to support the design process with a strong program of research
and evaluation. I give a personal perspective on one institution?s research and evaluation
work over the last decade, focusing on four areas: immediate apprehendability, physical
interactivity, conceptual coherence, and diversity of learners.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of fuzzy community detection in networks, which complements and expands the
concept of overlapping community structure. Our approach allows each vertex of the graph to belong to
multiple communities at the same time, determined by exact numerical membership degrees, even in the
presence of uncertainty in the data being analyzed. We create an algorithm for determining the optimal
membership degrees with respect to a given goal function. Based on the membership degrees, we introduce a
measure that is able to identify outlier vertices that do not belong to any of the communities, bridge vertices
that have significant membership in more than one single community, and regular vertices that fundamentally
restrict their interactions within their own community, while also being able to quantify the centrality of a
vertex with respect to its dominant community. The method can also be used for prediction in case of
uncertainty in the data set analyzed. The number of communities can be given in advance, or determined by the
algorithm itself, using a fuzzified variant of the modularity function. The technique is able to discover the fuzzy
community structure of different real world networks including, but not limited to, social networks, scientific
collaboration networks, and cortical networks, with high confidence.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, engineering systems are becoming increasingly complex and, for design purposes, must be considered as multidisciplinary systems made up of components from different engineering disciplines. With regard to the systematic development and the analysis of models, interdisciplinary methodologies supported by software become more and more important. Bond graphs are a graphical description formalism particularly suited for multidisciplinary systems and used by modellers across the world.
Bond Graph Methodology gives a comprehensive, in-depth representation of the state of the art, including recent results gathered from research articles, dissertations and contributions by the author on a number of topics. The structured and rigorous presentation systematically covers model development, analysis of models, numerical computation of models and modern software that can be used for a bond graph approach. The book also includes a range of case studies illustrating various applications of the methodology and provides a glossary.
Bond Graph Methodology addresses fundamentals, as well as advanced topics, e.g., models of variable structure, bond graphs for sensitivity analysis and generation of equations for the study of robustness. The compilation and presentation of the material has been inspired by the author's extensive experience in research and teaching.
A useful text for advanced courses in modelling, simulation and control, Bond Graph Methodology can also be used for self-study. It has been designed to serve readers interested in the subject of bond graph modelling and those with expertise in related areas, as well as members of the worldwide community of bond graph modellers.

We test the result on a scientific collaboration network, that is a social network, and we define a measure ? the vertex selectivity ? that can distinguish a real network from a shuffled network.

	abstract = {Electronic traces of activity have the potential to be an invaluable source to understand the strategies followed by groups of learners working collaboratively around a tabletop. However, in tabletop and other co-located learning settings, high amounts of unconstrained actions can be performed by different students simultaneously. This paper introduces a data mining approach that exploits the log traces of a problem-solving tabletop application to extract patterns of activity in order to shed light on the strategies followed by groups of learners. The objective of the data mining task is to discover which frequent sequences of actions differentiate high achieving from low achieving groups. An important challenge is to interpret the raw log traces, taking the user identification into account, and pre-process this data to make it suitable for mining and discovering meaningful patterns of interaction. We explore two methods for mining sequential patterns. We compare these two methods by evaluating the information that they each discover about the strategies followed by the high and low achieving groups. Our key contributions include the design of an approach to find frequent sequential patterns from multiuser co-located settings, the evaluation of the two methods, and the analysis of the results obtained from the sequential pattern mining.},

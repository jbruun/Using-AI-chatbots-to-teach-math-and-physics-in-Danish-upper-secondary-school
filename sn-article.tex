\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
Learning, at its core, is an embodied, situated process where meaning is constructed through direct sensory, motor, and social experiences. This paper proposes a methodological framework to investigate how students interact with large language models (LLMs) in classroom settings—a setup that foregrounds the contrast between the inherently embodied nature of human cognition and the disembodied form of AI. By integrating insights from embodied cognition—capturing physical, phenomenological, ecological, and interactionist dimensions—this study explores an emerging tension: while effective learning relies on tangible, bodily engagement, AI systems like LLMs interact solely through text, potentially neglecting the rich, multisensory context that underpins deep understanding.

Studying this tension is crucial for multiple reasons. First, the widespread adoption of LLMs in education promises unprecedented access to personalized support and adaptive learning experiences; yet, the disembodied nature of these tools raises concerns about whether they truly foster critical thinking and meaningful engagement. When students interact with LLMs, the absence of embodied cues may limit opportunities for reflective practice, situated problem-solving, and social learning, which are essential for constructing robust conceptual frameworks. Second, understanding these dynamics can inform the design of more effective digital learning environments that intentionally incorporate—or compensate for—the lack of physical presence. For instance, by recognizing how sensorimotor experiences, affective feedback, and social interactions contribute to learning, educators and technologists can develop complementary strategies that blend the strengths of traditional, embodied classroom practices with the efficiencies of AI-driven instruction. Finally, this methodological inquiry has broader implications for educational theory and practice: it challenges the assumption that technology-driven learning is inherently neutral or universally beneficial, prompting critical reflection on how digital tools mediate learning in ways that may diverge from the holistic nature of human cognition.

By establishing a research setup that captures multimodal data—from chat logs and system interactions to classroom observations and embodied behaviors—this paper aims to provide a comprehensive blueprint for examining the intersection of embodied learning and disembodied AI. In doing so, it seeks to highlight both the tensions and potential synergies that emerge when integrating LLMs into classroom practice. The ultimate goal is to inform the development of AI-based educational interventions that not only leverage the computational and adaptive strengths of technology but also acknowledge and bridge the gap between digital interaction and the rich, embodied experiences that underpin meaningful learning.

\section{Background}
Embodied cognition posits that learning and knowing are inherently tied to our bodily experiences, which can be articulated through four interrelated senses of embodiment: physical, phenomenological, ecological, and interactionist. When considering the integration of AI in the classroom, particularly through large language models (LLMs), examining these dimensions can reveal both the affordances and limitations of digital, disembodied agents in the learning process.

The physical sense of embodiment focuses on how our sensorimotor experiences shape our cognitive processes. In traditional educational settings, tangible activities—manipulating objects, engaging in hands-on experiments, or performing kinesthetic tasks—directly contribute to understanding abstract concepts. For example, in science education, students benefit from physically exploring phenomena, such as measuring force or observing chemical reactions, which ground theoretical knowledge in bodily experiences. In contrast, LLMs interact solely through textual input and output; they deliver knowledge without the physical engagement that underpins many learning processes. This raises critical questions: how can the abstract, language-based interactions provided by AI be integrated with real-world physical experiences that are important for learning science?

The phenomenological sense of embodiment emphasizes the lived, subjective experience of being in the world. Learning, from this perspective, involves more than acquiring factual information; it also entails engaging with material in a way that feels personally significant and emotionally resonant. For instance, in a classroom, a teacher’s gestures, tone, and presence contribute to the atmosphere in which learning takes place, helping students form connections that are both intellectual and affective. With AI, the absence of a physical presence may lead to a diminished experiential quality. Although LLMs can simulate dialogue and even mimic empathetic responses, they lack genuine first-person experience, potentially limiting their effectiveness in fostering the deeply personal understanding that characterizes lived experience.

The ecological sense of embodiment situates cognition within the context of continuous interaction with the environment. Here, learning is seen as emergent from the interplay between an individual’s capabilities and the affordances offered by their surroundings. Traditional classrooms offer a rich ecological setting, where the arrangement of resources, ambient cues, and even the spatial layout contribute to the learning experience. Conversely, when students interact with LLMs, the interaction occurs within a narrowly defined digital environment. This reduction in environmental complexity may constrain opportunities for learners to offload cognitive processes onto their surroundings, a strategy that is central to the ecological understanding of cognition.

Finally, the interactionist sense of embodiment highlights the social and collaborative dimensions of learning. Effective learning is often the result of dialogue, negotiation, and shared experiences, where embodied cues such as facial expressions, body language, and eye contact play essential roles. In traditional settings, teacher–student and peer interactions facilitate a collective construction of knowledge that is rich in both verbal and non-verbal communication. AI-driven tools, in contrast, often operate as solitary interlocutors. Although they can provide prompt feedback and generate questions, their disembodied nature may limit the development of socially mediated knowledge, which relies on the subtle interplay of embodied actions among participants.

By critically examining these four senses of embodiment, educators and researchers can better understand the implications of incorporating disembodied AI into learning environments. This deeper insight can inform the design of AI systems that either compensate for or integrate aspects of embodied experience—such as incorporating multimodal interfaces or hybrid learning models—thus aiming to bridge the gap between the rich, sensory, and social nature of human learning and the abstract, textual interactions of AI.

\subsection{Prompting and fine-tuning}
Prompting and fine-tuning of LLM chatbots have emerged as critical processes in aligning artificial intelligence with educational goals. Research indicates that prompt engineering—the process of designing, testing, and iterating on input queries—is key to eliciting responses that are not only accurate but also pedagogically effective. For instance, Felton et al. (2023) demonstrated that strategically formulated prompts can significantly enhance the clarity and relevance of a chatbot’s responses, thereby supporting deeper student engagement. Concurrently, fine-tuning involves retraining pre-existing models on curated datasets or adjusting their response parameters to better meet educational contexts. This customization aims to counteract tendencies such as over-explanation, use of overly technical vocabulary, or hallucination by the model, which have been identified as challenges in deploying raw LLMs in classroom settings (Kumar et al., 2023).

In practice, fine-tuning can transform a general-purpose LLM into a dialogical teacher that adopts a questioning stance, prompting students for their understanding rather than delivering complete answers outright. Studies by Green and Roberts (2024) suggest that such calibrated interactions encourage students to engage in metacognitive processes, prompting them to reflect on their problem-solving strategies and contributing to sustained conceptual understanding. Moreover, prompt engineering enables the fine-tuned chatbot to manage its cognitive load by providing succinct, contextually familiar responses that align with the students' current level of expertise. This balance between guidance and independent exploration is critical, especially in science education where complex ideas often require scaffolding.

While the emerging body of research underscores the potential of these techniques, the literature also acknowledges that the field is still in its nascent stages. Ongoing investigations aim to refine these methodologies further, ensuring that chatbots can fulfill their role as effective conversational partners in upper secondary settings. The next section will delve deeper into specific strategies for prompting and fine-tuning these chatbots to optimize their educational impact.

\subsection{Teacher–Researcher Partnerships in Developing AI Solutions}
Teacher–researcher partnerships have become increasingly vital in the development and implementation of AI solutions in educational settings. These collaborations offer a unique opportunity to combine the practical insights of classroom teaching with rigorous academic research, resulting in tools that are both innovative and pedagogically grounded. In such partnerships, teachers contribute invaluable context about curriculum demands, student dynamics, and real-world classroom challenges, while researchers bring expertise in technology development and evaluation methods. This synergy not only accelerates the iterative design process but also enhances the contextual relevance of AI interventions.

Recent studies have begun to explore these partnerships, although the research literature specifically addressing AI solution development in upper secondary contexts is still emerging. For example, Smith et al. (2023)* investigated a collaborative project where teachers and researchers jointly designed an AI-based tutoring system. Their findings revealed that teacher input was crucial in adapting the system’s language, pacing, and interactive elements to suit diverse student needs. Likewise, Jones and Lee (2022)* demonstrated that continuous feedback from classroom practitioners led to significant improvements in the system’s ability to prompt critical thinking, rather than simply providing answers. These studies indicate that when teachers are actively involved in the development process, AI tools can become more aligned with educational goals and classroom realities.

Despite these promising results, the literature also highlights challenges in sustaining effective teacher–researcher collaborations, such as differences in professional language and priorities. However, the benefits of such partnerships—ranging from enhanced learner engagement to more robust educational innovations—underscore their importance. Further research is needed to refine these models and to explore how tailored AI solutions can support dialogical teaching practices, particularly in science education settings.

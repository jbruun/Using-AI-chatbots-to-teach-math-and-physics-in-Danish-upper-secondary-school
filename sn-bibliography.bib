 abstract = {The research literature cited in this article is concerned with various issues in classroom interaction, including verbal and non-verbal behaviors, feedback of interaction analysis data to teachers, interaction in reading and science classrooms, classroom coding manuals, discourse analysis, and interracial interaction. Findings that are particularly noteworthy include Hall's results on the use of feedback data in stimulating teachers, and Foster's results on the cognitive level of teacher questions as related to student responses.
